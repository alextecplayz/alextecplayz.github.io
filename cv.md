## Professional experience

**May-June 2024 — Data Operator (Contract-based) — Gherla Municipal Hospital**\
*Gherla — IT Software, Health — Contract-based pay, approx. 3000 RON / €600 / $685 (net pay) total*

I worked as a contractor for approximately one month for the Gherla Municipal Hospital, “Analysis Laboratory” section, for the preparations of the annual RENAR (National Romanian Accreditation Association[^1]) inspection.

I entered data such as the results of the laboratory analyses in Excel and Word, using the hospital's defined standards for drafting. Furthermore, I helped to help rewrite and reorganize the General Management System used to achieve RENAR standards, as well as drafting changes during the inspection.

This activity required my full attention to ensure that I did not enter invalid or non-compliant results. It also included 'regular office work', which included printing papers with the requested changes, printing entire standards dossiers, receiving, inspecting, and entering information from product sheets related to laboratory equipment and consumables, laboratory centrifuge results, and similar laboratory devices.

**February-June 2025 — Customer Information Officer - Fan Courier Cluj-Napoca**\
*Cluj-Napoca — Dispatch Department (February 3-May 26) — Full-time (8-10 hours), 2800 RON / €558 / $640 (net pay) salary per month*

The activity consisted of using 3 main programs — Microsoft Excel, and two internal programs, one used for entering pickup orders, sending/placing (changing each order's status) them to the couriers' PDAs, changing statuses, checking the pickup address, etc.; and a program for checking expeditions' statuses in the warehouse (e.g., which zone of the local warehouse, shelf), as well as generating Excel and in-program reports on statuses of courier shipments, and the streets they operate on, daily, calling or responding to courier phone calls regarding certain expeditions (e.g., if the order was picked up by another courier, if the order was cancelled, if the order was re-directed to be picked up from a different address).

The activity also consisted of checking department emails, creating daily pickup orders from companies or home pickup orders, complaints, and questions / statuses of shipments. It also included taking phone calls intended to place home pickup orders, both from individuals and companies.

The working hours were between 8 AM and 5 PM, with regular shifts that lasted up to 6 PM to ensure that all orders were picked up by couriers.

*Cluj-Napoca — Customer Reception Department (May 27-Present)*

Following an internal restructuring of departments under recently-changed leadership, I was moved to the customer reception department. Here, I have direct contact with the customers, creating shipments to other FAN offices and addresses within the country, as well as in other countries.

Furthermore, it includes checking the status of packages by tracking AWB numbers using the previously-mentioned internal program that was used for checking expeditions' statuses in the warehouse; handing over packages and collecting transportation or remuneration by cash or card; as well as handling customer disputes regarding orders being automatically sent to FANboxes by certain expediter companies, complaints, and other procedures.

The working hours are from 9 AM to 5 PM or from 11 AM to 7:20 PM.

## Other notable work
