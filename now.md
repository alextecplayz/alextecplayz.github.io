### 2025

#### February

I'm starting two mini-post series!

- Constructed Spaces, in which I would cover game environments, how they're developed, inspired from, gameplay and player effects. So far, in my queue I've added CONTROL and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
- Vibes & Scores, in which I would write about game soundtracks. So far, in my queue I've added Atomic Heart, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Minecraft, Minecraft Dungeons, and both seasons of Minecraft: Story Mode (as their own separate posts).
- HITMAN World of Assassination review (has been postponed from January)
- Feb 2: Small improvements to the site, for the new things to come:
  - Using Liquid to automatically generate the TOC instead of doing it manually
  - Lists now use vertical lines similar to `old.reddit.com` to emphasize the sublevel of the list contents
  - More themes!
  - More CSS adjustments to make things even more refined.
  - Added a [/playground](https://alextecplayz.github.io/playground) page that I use for theme and CSS testing and development
  - Added a [/now](https://alextecplayz.github.io/now) page, I'd like to update it daily, but it probably will be updated weekly, if I don't have time at the end of the day for it
  - Updated /external/sharedweb's highlight.js code
  - Updated /external/sharedweb's Blaec font to use TTF instead of Woff2, because it kept generating warnings
  - Also created a visual [/sitemap](https://alextecplayz.github.io/sitemap) to more easily navigate around the site
  - This will be followed by a Vanta Interactive site update as well, to bring it up to speed with the latest Obisidan changes and guidelines

#### January

- Jan 30: Got hired! On Monday, Feb 3 I'm going to sign the job contract and will work for ~7 months until August when, if my (in late June) I get accepted into college, I'll give my 20 days notice, since at least at this time they don't allow hybrid, remote or part-time work. I won't specify the company name, but they're a well-known courier company from Romania, I'll be working in a Dispatch role, assigning packages to couriers based on their assigned zones or routes, with good enough pay to start. The next big thing on my list is HRT, I'll start seriously looking into it very soon, it *shouldn't* be expensive, thankfully.
- Jan 29:
  - The soundtrack - [Atomic Heart, Vol. 5 (Original Game Soundtrack)](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_k01QjqatkiZLOiQd0RInblY_6XkQ40_28) - was released at midnight Romania (UTC+2) time. So far, I've listened to it *5* times and counting. The most-played song for me is '[В синем море, в белой пене (Оставайся, мальчик, с нами) [Geoffrey Day Remix]](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=pGhTP-wxGMA)' (In the blue sea, in the white foam (Stay with us, boy) [Geoffrey Day Remix]), which is absolutely incredible. It's THE highlight of the soundtrack.
  - Also started writing my Comprehensive Android Guide, slated to release on February 2, in which I cover choosing a device, choosing a custom ROM, unlocking your device's bootloader, installing a custom recovery, installing a custom ROM, installing a custom kernel, rooting your device, setting it up with a privacy and security-first mindset, installing a VPN and DNS, and many more sections on blocking ads, trackers, disabling or uninstalling bloatware, minimizing the privacy impact in apps such as WhatsApp Business, and a lot more. It's basically everything I know about Android.
- Jan 28: [Atomic Heart: Enchantment Under the Sea](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2214823/Atomic_Heart__Enchantment_Under_the_Sea/) (DLC#3) came out, it's absolutely fantastic. On my Steam curator page I rated it as Recommended: "Great DLC with a supremely wonderful soundtrack, disgusting new creatures and heavy inspiration from Bioshock and Subnautica. Enchantment Under the Sea successfully enchants an already splendid game."
- Jan 27: Discovered many new songs on the Explore page of InnerTune (YouTube Music client). Songs I can absolutely recommend:
