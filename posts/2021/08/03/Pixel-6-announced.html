Both the Google Pixel 6 and the 6 Pro will be powered by Google's new SOC (System-on-Chip), Tensor, which Google claims to be a competitor to the latest chips from Qualcomm, Huawei, Apple and Samsung.</p>

        <p class="post-text rem1-5 outfit medium">After such a long time, Google has finally changed their camera sensors. Up until this line-up, Google has used Google Pixel 2’s camera sensor on all of their phones - which isn’t bad, especially because it also has AI by its side, but it’s certainly a welcome change.</p>
        <p class="post-text rem1-5 outfit medium">Google has shown a few different features they promise to integrate with this new line-up, most notably a new face unblurring feature.</p>
        <p class="post-text rem1-5 outfit medium">They’ve shown a video with a moving toddler, whose face was pretty blurry. Using their new AI from the TPU module, the phone managed to sharpen the face by taking multiple photos. Keep in mind, this was a Google-provided video showing the phone’s very best capabilities, therefore the phone may not take such good videos when the consumers get their hands on the phones.</p>

        <p id="Tensor" class="post-section rem2">The new Tensor chip&emsp;<a class="post-section-link rem1-5" href="#Tensor">Copy Link</a></p>

        <p class="post-text rem1-5 outfit medium">Google's new SoC is focused mostly on AI, and they claim it was 4 years into production. As I mentioned in the Camera section, their new TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) module is capable of unblurring faces on videos with a lot of motion, but that's just one of the new AI features. In addition, this new SoC can apply AI and computational photography to video, such as automatically adjusting HDR and the white balance of a video.</p>
        <p class="post-text rem1-5 outfit medium">It can also use the TPU module to provide better, instantaneous captioning to media being played on the phone, it can let you edit text while using text-to-speech and much, much more.</p>
        <p class="post-text rem1-5 outfit medium">It is unclear yet how the actual performance of the chip is, so this remains unknown at the time of writing.</p>

        <p id="Battery" class="post-section rem2">Battery&emsp;<a class="post-section-link rem1-5" href="#AnyUpdates">Copy Link</a></p>

        <p class="post-text rem1-5 outfit medium">The Pixel phones’ battery life has never been good, especially when you compare them to Samsung or Apple’s flagships, which can last a lot more. With the Pixel 6 line-up, Google promises “all day” endurance, which is a bit disappointing for some people who aren’t accustomed to the battery life of Google phones.</p>
        <p class="post-text rem1-5 outfit medium">The Pro variant comes with 5000 mAh while the base variant comes with 4614 mAh, both will feature faster wireless charging because Google is reportedly developing a better Pixel Stand which will decrease the time needed for the phones to charge wirelessly, and the new phones will feature a new change in the Battery menu, a new setting which helps optimize the battery charging, for example the battery will slowly charge overnight to something like 90%, and close to when the alarm rings, it will charge the phone to 100%, to not overcharge and decrease the battery life. Other phones from manufacturers like Sony and Samsung had this option for years, so it’s good to see Google adding this feature.</p>

        <p id="Opinion" class="post-section rem2">My Opinion&emsp;<a class="post-section-link rem1-5" href="#Opinion">Copy Link</a></p>

        <p class="post-text rem1-5 outfit medium">The new Google Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro look strikingly similar to Samsung's Galaxy Note lineup, perhaps Google wanted to release the Note 21 we never received this year, due to chip shortages and other issues on Samsung's side. The slightly curved screen on the phone's edges are similar to the older Galaxy S8 and S9 phones, while the glossy aluminum rails on the sides are certainly similar to the Samsung Galaxy Note phones. The selfie camera hole also looks like it's inspired by the Note 10/20's look. The back of the phone is made out of glass, and if I'd get this phone, I would certainly put a case on it, mostly to avoid scratches and to have my phone at a normal angle instead of a slightly raised top.</p>
