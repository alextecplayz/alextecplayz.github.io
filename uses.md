- HP Pavilion 300 mouse
- Spacer SPKB-520 keyboard
- XBOX Series XS wireless controller
- Lexmark X1170 printer (used for scanning purposes, but theoretically could print as well, if I were to get ink for it)

## Devices

- [Daily driver] Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 (4/64GB, Android 14 using PixysOS custom ROM / spes, NOT the 4G or China variant, this one uses Snapdragon 680 4G)
- [Previous] Samsung Galaxy A10 (2/32GB, Android 11-14 using custom ROMs such as crDroid and LineageOS)

## Software

### Cross-platform
- [Element](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.app/) - The best Matrix client for web, desktop and mobile (*@alextecplayz:matrix.org*)
- [LocalSend](https://localsend.org/) - Encrypted PC<->Mobile file transfer
- [KDE Connect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/) / [GSConnect](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1319/gsconnect/) - Android notifications, file transfer to PC and vice-versa
- [OpenTTD](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.openttd.fdroid/) - Fun open-source transportation game
- [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) - Android display capture and control from the PC
- [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock) - (cross-platform because you can run it on Termux) an OSINT terminal tool that allows you to search the web for accounts that match specific usernames
- [Stack Wallet](https://stackwallet.com/) - Open-source cryptocurrency wallet that supports many cryptocurrencies, and you control your private keys. Encrypted backups and an in-app exchange are available as well. **Would recommend** if you need to use or hoard cryptocurrency
- [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) - Cross-platform torrent stream app. Install some plugins from the [Stremio Add-Ons](https://stremio-addons.netlify.app/) community list, and you can access whatever you want: porn, scraped torrent providers such as YTS, EZTV, RARBG, 1337x, TPB, KickassTorrents, Rutor, Rutracker, you can see the streaming catalogs from Netflix, Amazon Prime, you can get additional info such as IMDB ratings directly in the page for what you want to stream, etc. It's a hidden gold-mine

### Desktop
- [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) - Powerful KDE/Qt-based video editor for Linux
- [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/) - Build models with voxels. I use it extensively. If you want to see some spectacular creations using MagicaVoxel, [MadMaraca](https://madmaraca.art/) does some outstanding work
- [Minecraft Bedrock Launcher](https://bedrocklauncher.github.io/) - Play Android versions of Minecraft on Linux. Has support for the latest versions, is continuously updated, and has architecture support for all architectures used by the app, which is why it works not only on regular x86, x86_64 Linux distros, but also on arm and arm64 Linux distros including mobile Linux distros such as postmarketOS, Droidian and Ubuntu Touch
- [Pitivi](http://pitivi.org/) - GTK and Python-powered FOSS video editor for Linux. It's not as powerful as Kdenlive
- [Portmaster](https://safing.io/) - FOSS firewall for Linux and Windows. Compatible with my [filterlist](https://github.com/alextecplayz/filterlist)
- [ProtonUp](https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/) - Easily add or remove custom Proton versions on Steam and Lutris, such as Proton-GE
- [qBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) - Don't use anything else if you want a FOSS torrent client. uTorrent is malware and adware, BitTorrent is malware and shady as fuck
- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) - FOSS/Libre version of VSCode that doesn't enable Microsoft trackers by default. Some Microsoft-owned extensions are not available by default, but you can manually install/import them if you already have regular VSCode, you just copy the entire folder and it works with no hitches

### Mobile
- [Aegis Authenticator](https://getaegis.app/) - 2FA authenticator with encrypted backups, automatic backups after each modification
- [AFWall+](https://ukanth.github.io/afwall/) - (**root required**) firewall to restrict network access on a per-app basis
- [Applist Detector](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ApplistDetector) - (**root required**) helps to see if apps could detect Magisk, Magisk modules and other "suspicious" apps
- [Apps](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Apps) - to update the GrapheneOS camera, GrapheneOS PDF apps
- [aShell You](https://github.com/DP-Hridayan/aShellYou) - Run ADB commands from a Material You-styled ADB shell app
- [Aurora Store](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore) - Google Play front-end that does not require a Google account
- [BitDefender Antivirus Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitdefender.antivirus) - JUST the antivirus, it's free and does not require an account or subscription. It's not a trial either
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) - Encrypted password manager
- [Buckwheat](https://buckwheat.app/) - Helps you spend money wisely, although I'm yet to use it
- [Cromite](https://github.com/uazo/cromite) - Hardened Chromium browser based on the now-defunct Bromite browser, by uazo, one of the main contributors, with very frequent updates
- [Droid-ify](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.looker.droidify/) - The best F-Droid client I have ever used, uses Material You

- [Franco Kernel Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.franco.kernel) - Can control everything about the device's kernel. Per-app performance profiles, GPU and CPU underclocking, Z-RAM, swap, SELinux, etc
- [Gboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin) - Arguably the best keyboard on Android, if you like Material You. Blocked all network access via the system settings and AFWall+, Gboard cannot share or upload any personalization data
- [GitHub](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android) - The best GitHub app on mobile, but it could do better, honestly
- [GMaps VW](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/us.spotco.maps/) - A WebView app for Google Maps. Nothing more, nothing less
- [Google Recorder](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-recorder/google-recorder-2-1-347255046-release/) - Use the provided version if you do not have a Google Pixel device. Newer versions of the app WILL NOT WORK properly otherwise! Requires [Speech Recognition and Synthesis from Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.tts) if you want to recognize speech when recording audio
- [hKtweaks](https://github.com/corsicanu/hKtweaks) - Kernel manager specifically designed to support Exynos processors. Same functionality as FKM
- [Hypatia](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/us.spotco.malwarescanner/) - An open-source malware scanner. It might not work well, unfortunately, and development is stale
- [Lawnicons](https://lawnchair.app/downloads/) - Great icon pack that fits the default, Pixel-like icon pack
- [LogFox](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.f0x1d.logfox/) - Best logcat app, using Material You
- [Lucky Patcher](https://www.luckypatchers.com/) - Kind of an obscure one, maybe not used as much these days, but you can patch in-app purchases. It can also patch out ads, trackers and app permissions, and works with root
- [Markdown Editor](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/com.adeeteya.markdown_editor) - Very simple, minimalist, Markdown editor app. I didn't really use it, however, since I don't generally edit or write code, posts on mobile. That might change in the future, who knows
- [MEGA](https://mega.nz) - Encrypted storage from a privacy-friendly company
- [Megalodon](https://sk22.github.io/megalodon/) - The current Mastodon app I use on mobile. I used to use Moshidon and the official Mastodon app. Development seems to be stale now, which is unfortunate
- [microG](https://microg.org/) - Open-source implementation of some of the functionality from Google Mobile Services
- [Mint Calculator](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/bored.codebyk.mintcalc/) - A great alternative to the Material You calculator from Google, and it has extra features such as converters
- [monocles Chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.monocles.chat/) - XMPP chat client (*alextecplayz@conversations.im*)
- [MRepo](https://github.com/MRepoApp/MRepo/) - Magisk repo and module browser / manager app
- [Mull](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.fennec_dos/) - Deblobbed, privacy-oriented Firefox browser for Android. **Keep in mind that Firefox is NOT as secure as Chromium-based browsers, especially on Android! Use Mulch, Vanadium or Cromite if you want security!**
- [Mulch System WebView](https://divestos.org) - DivestOS' hardened Chromium system webview, using some of the patches used by GrapheneOS' Vanadium browser
- [NFSee](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.nfc.nfsee/) - Read/dump NFC tag and card data
- [Nothing Recorder](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/nothing-technology-limited/nothing-recorder/nothing-recorder-1-6-0-release/) - Simple, minimalist sound recorder app from Nothing. Microphone options won't do anything unless you have a Nothing device
- [OONI Probe](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.openobservatory.ooniprobe/) - Run some tests on your network to see if any supported services are blocked or censored by your government
- [OpenFoodFacts](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/openfoodfacts.github.scrachx.openfood/) - Open-source, community-run food information app. You can scan bar codes for known products and get nutritional information, nutritional score, ingredients, eco score (environmental rating), nutritional quality, additive information, ingredient analysis, food processing level, packaging, transportation and more. **This is a must-have!**
- [**OpenVPN for pDNSf**](https://www.zenz-solutions.de/openvpn-for-personaldnsfilter/) - Allows you to run OpenVPN while using personalDNSfilter as an actual DNS filter, if you have root. **This is a must-have**, in my opinion.
- [OSS Document Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.akylas.documentscanner) - As the name suggests, it's an open-source document scanner with OCR support
- [**personalDNSfilter**](https://www.zenz-solutions.de/personaldnsfilter-wp/) - DNS filter proxy app. Allows you to import filterlists (such as [my own](https://github.com/alextecplayz/filterlist)) in order to block certain websites. If you have root, it will run as an actual DNS filter. If you don't, it will use Android's VPN functionality to route everything through the app.
- [Prognoza](https://github.com/davidtakac/prognoza) - Simple, yet insightful FOSS weather app for Android
- [Read You](https://f-droid.org/packages/me.ash.reader/) - Simple FOSS RSS reader with Material You support
- [RootlessJamesDSP](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/me.timschneeberger.rootlessjamesdsp/) - System-wide audio processing engine, that doesn't require root!
- [Saber](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.adilhanney.saber/) - FOSS note-taking app that supports cloud backups and handwriting, I highly recommend it!
- [Samsung Food](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foodient.whisk) - Has so many cooking recipes, it's insane. It shows nutritional information as well, which is very useful
- [Samsung Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.shealth&hl=en&gl=US) - I can't use the official app because Samsung enforces OneUI, so I use a modified version from [SamsungAppsPatcher](https://adil.hanney.org/SamsungAppsPatcher/) instead
- [Samsung Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.app.notes) - One of the better note-taking apps on Android, with handwriting support
- [Shelter](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.typeblog.shelter/) - Takes advantage of the built-in support for work profiles on Android in order to create a new user where you can install separate apps. Helpful if say, you want to run WhatsApp or Instagram on the same device, but you want it to be sandboxed and not be able to check your contacts, files, app list
- [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) - Helps apps access highly-privileged APIs without root access. Needed for apps such as aShell You to work without root.
- [SnoopSnitch](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.srlabs.snoopsnitch/) - Open-source app that analyzes your mobile network to check for vulnerabilities, security, and to warn you about potentially fake base stations such as IMSI catchers. Does not work on Android 14, unfortunately. **Requires a Qualcomm-based, rooted Android device to work!**
- [Survival Manual](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.ligi.survivalmanual/) - Helpful offline survival manual, provides great tips in case you get stranded somewhere, or the apocalypse happens
- [Telegram FOSS](https://github.com/Telegram-FOSS-Team/Telegram-FOSS) - FOSS version of the Telegram app. You can't receive your login/sign up verification code as a notification with this app, so make sure you already have Telegram installed (on whatever device) in order to receive your code
- [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) - VERY useful, however you need to know what you're doing, especially if you grant it root access, otherwise you might break your device
- [Trail Sense](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.kylecorry.trail_sense/) - Spectacular app if you want to travel through the wilderness. It has many useful features, such as beacons, backtrack (step retracing), weather prediction, compass
- [Twine](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/dev.sasikanth.rss.reader) - RSS reader with Material You, and a bottom bar. I would pick this above Read You, however it does not have an in-app browser, and it has/had lag issues on my Galaxy A10. I will try it out again very soon, however
- [ViMusic](https://f-droid.org/packages/it.vfsfitvnm.vimusic/) - FOSS YouTube Music frontend with no account support
- [Warden](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AppWarden) - Get local statistics on what trackers and loggers the apps installed on your device use, similar to Exodus
- [WebApps](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.tobykurien.webapps/) - Turn any site into a sandboxed PWA. I use this heavily, as I have multiple PWAs for documentation related to CMake, DirectX, MDN, Meson, OpenGL and Vulkan, PWAs like ADS-B Exchange, Coinranking and Periodex
