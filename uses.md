Software, hardware and services that I use for various things, personal and professional.

## Hardware

- Esperanza PC Studio Pro microphone ($7), good enough microphone for meetings and whatnot, with included holder
- HP Compaq 8200 Elite SFF (i7-2600 vPro @3.40Ghz, 8GB RAM (2x4 DDR3 1333Mhz), MSI GeForce GTX 1650 LP 4GB GDDR5, Seagate Barracuda 1TB HDD, Seagate Barracuda 7200.12 500 GB HDD)
- HP Pavilion 300 mouse
- Lexmark X1170 printer (used for scanning purposes, but theoretically could print as well, if I were to get ink for it)
- Phillips 3000 Series LED TV 22" (22PFL3405H-12)
- Razer Kiyo X webcam (720p60 / 1080p60), good enough for meetings and whatnot, I got it for quite cheap ($37), I think it was worth that much
- Spacer SPKB-520 keyboard
- XBOX Series XS wireless controller

## Devices

- [Daily driver] Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 (4/64GB, Android 14 using PixysOS custom ROM / spes, NOT the 4G or China variant, this one uses Snapdragon 680 4G)
- [Previous] Samsung Galaxy A10 (2/32GB, Android 11-14 using custom ROMs such as crDroid and LineageOS)

## Software

### Operating Systems

- [Android](https://source.android.com/) 14 // Using PixysOS custom ROM - Using microG instead of GAPPS, I have root using Magisk, but have blacklisted certain apps, which allows me to use banking apps again. Of course, if you can, use [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) // [Donate](https://grapheneos.org/donate) - which is currently exclusive to Google Pixel devices, because, ironically enough, Google seems to be the most open and provide the most secure devices out of every other big phone company.
- [Debian](https://debian.org) Trixie/Sid // [Donate](https://www.debian.org/donations) - Migrated in less than two days from Ubuntu 23.10, completely seamless and works just as well, if not actually better. I can access newer versions of software and whatnot in a 'semi-rolling' release, instead of having to to jump from one Ubuntu version to the next (*yes, I like to live near the bleeding edge when it comes to stuff such as GNOME DE and app updates, among other software, something that isn't as easy to do on Ubuntu*). Very stable, stuff just works. Initially I wanted to try Fedora, but I didn't want to familiarize myself with a different package manager, I think APT is just fine as it is, and I don't see why I should change from what works.
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) - My previous Linux operating system, that I started using two years ago (20.04, was it?), up until 23.10, after which I moved to Debian 13 trixie/sid, because I didn't like the update cycle, nor did I like having to upgrade from time to time, so a 'semi-rolling' release would work better for me instead. I like it, but it comes with stuff such as Snap, and some Ubuntu stuff that I don't like. And now that I compare it with Debian, I think Debian might run smoother in some cases, not by much, but there is a slight performance difference.

### Web-based

- [ADS-B Exchange](https://globe.adsbexchange.com/) - open-source flight tracker, with optional API for personal, non-profit or enterprise usage
- [cobalt](https://cobalt.tools) // [Donate (Boosty)](https://boosty.to/wukko/donate) - open-source, no-frills, no-bullshit media downloader for a lot of sites
- [Iceshrimp](https://iceshrimp.dev/iceshrimp/iceshrimp) // [Donate to the frontend dev](https://bunq.me/lilianhealthcarefund) - With some additions from the open PRs, issues, some themes, and my own Obsidian Design on top. It's completely squared and pretty much ready to be used, I can run it locally with zero issues. The problem is that it's Iceshrimp, and it unfortunately lags behind Mastodon. I don't fully like it, but it's quite intuitive and MUCH easier to self-host
- [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon) // [Sponsor](https://sponsor.joinmastodon.org/) - With a couple of changes *(Adding Nileane's [Tangerine UI](https://github.com/nileane/TangerineUI-for-Mastodon) theme as an option, Roni Laukkarinen's [Bird UI](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/mastodon-bird-ui) as an option, some upstream PRs that are still open such as [Grouped Notifications](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30440), [Confirmation Modals](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30884)*, as a preparation for my own self-hosted Mastodon instance, social.vantainteractive.com. Strangely, I can't self-host it on my localhost, it just fails to load, as it automatically upgrades my HTTP connection to HTTPS. I've tried everything, no dice. Oh well.
- [Mastodon Glitch Edition](https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon/) - It has a couple big changes over Mastodon, mainly media improvements, post formatting, local-only posts, threaded mode, highlighting misleading links. I think I'll switch to Mastodon Glitch Edition instead, it seems to be up-to-date, and I can merge my own additions on top + adding Obsidian and some Iceshrimp things, if I can.

### Cross-platform
- [Element](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.app/) // [Donate (Matrix.org Foundation)](https://matrix.org/support/) - The best Matrix client for web, desktop and mobile (*@alextecplayz:matrix.org*)
- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) // [Donate](https://fund.godotengine.org/) - Cross-platform game editor and game engine. Both the editor and packaged games can run on Android, Linux, macOS, Windows and even through a Web Editor (the web editor is not recommended, however, because it lacks some features).
- [LocalSend](https://localsend.org/) // [Donate (GitHub Sponsors)](https://github.com/sponsors/Tienisto) - Encrypted PC<->Mobile file transfer
- [KDE Connect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/) // [Donate (KDE.org)](https://kde.org/community/donations/) / [GSConnect](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1319/gsconnect/) - Android notifications, file transfer to PC and vice-versa
- [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org) // [Donate (OpenTTD.org)](https://www.openttd.org/donate), [OpenTTD - Android](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.openttd.fdroid/) - Fun open-source transportation game (unofficial fork for Android)
- [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) // [Donate (GitHub Sponsors)](https://github.com/sponsors/rom1v) - Android display capture and control from the PC
- [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock) - (cross-platform because you can run it on Termux) an OSINT terminal tool that allows you to search the web for accounts that match specific usernames
- [Stack Wallet](https://stackwallet.com/) // [Donate (StackWallet.com)](https://stackwallet.com/donate.html) - Open-source cryptocurrency wallet that supports many cryptocurrencies, and you control your private keys. Encrypted backups and an in-app exchange are available as well. **Would recommend** if you need to use or hoard cryptocurrency
- [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) - Cross-platform torrent stream app. Install some plugins from the [Stremio Add-Ons](https://stremio-addons.netlify.app/) community list, and you can access whatever you want: porn, scraped torrent providers such as YTS, EZTV, RARBG, 1337x, TPB, KickassTorrents, Rutor, Rutracker, you can see the streaming catalogs from Netflix, Amazon Prime, you can get additional info such as IMDB ratings directly in the page for what you want to stream, etc. It's a hidden gold-mine

### Desktop
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) 4.0.2 (UE 4.27.2 requirement), 2022.2.1 Patch 2 (UE 5.2.1 requirement) and Preview (non-Unreal use, mostly for GitHub projects) - I really like the new interface, it works quite well, if not almost flawless, in my experience. It's fast, intelligent and more than adequate to develop or decompile Android apps (decompiling using JADX).
- [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) // [Donate (kdenlive.org)](https://kdenlive.org/en/fund/) - Powerful KDE/Qt-based video editor for Linux
- [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/) // [Donate (Patreon)](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=2650949&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fephtracy.github.io%2F&utm_medium=widget) - Build models with voxels. I use it extensively. If you want to see some spectacular creations using MagicaVoxel, [MadMaraca](https://madmaraca.art/) does some outstanding work. **Closed-source program!**
- [Minecraft Bedrock Launcher (Linux)](https://mcpelauncher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) // [Donate (PayPal)](https://paypal.me/christopherhx) - Play Android versions of Minecraft on Linux. Has support for the latest versions, is continuously updated, and has architecture support for all architectures used by the app, which is why it works not only on regular x86, x86_64 Linux distros, but also on arm and arm64 Linux distros including mobile Linux distros such as postmarketOS, Droidian and Ubuntu Touch
- [Pitivi](http://pitivi.org/) // [Donate (pitivi.org)](https://pitivi.org/donators/) - GTK and Python-powered FOSS video editor for Linux. It's not as powerful as Kdenlive
- [Portmaster](https://safing.io/) // [Donate (GitHub Sponsors)](https://github.com/sponsors/safing) - FOSS firewall for Linux and Windows. Compatible with my [filterlist](https://github.com/alextecplayz/filterlist)
- [ProtonUp](https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/) // [Donate (Ko-Fi)](https://ko-fi.com/V7V06QGTS) - Easily add or remove custom Proton versions on Steam and Lutris, such as Proton-GE
- [qBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) // [Donate (qBittorrent.org)](https://www.qbittorrent.org/donate) - Don't use anything else if you want a FOSS torrent client. uTorrent is malware and adware, BitTorrent is malware and shady as fuck
- [Unreal Engine](https://unrealengine.com) - Epic Games-developed, **source-available** (NOT open-source, [there are differences between the two, despite some overlap](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/free-vs-open-source-software)) multi-platform game engine. I have used 4.21, 4.24, 4.25, 4.26, 5.0EA1, 5.0 Preview, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.1.1, 5.3.1, 5.4 Preview, now I only use 4.27.2 and 5.2.1, they're seemingly the most stable for me. 4.27.2 isn't really used anymore however, despite it being much lighter than 5.X, it can't be used for mobile development due to requirements from Google Play that keep updating their Play Billing library. Use 5.2.1+ for this. Despite my long-term experience and usage of Unreal, I really don't trust Epic Games and I'd rather switch, which is why I'm developing [Sapphire](https://docs.vantainteractive.com/en/sapphire/) for internal (and possibly public) use.
- [Virtualbox](https://virtualbox.org/) - Multi-platform Virtual Machine manager that works on Windows, macOS and Linux hosts, and can run a lot of guest OSes. Can also be used by the Genymobile Android emulator, which is probably the most performant Android emulator on Linux, next to Waydroid.
- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) // [Donate (BTC)](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium?tab=readme-ov-file#donate) - FOSS/Libre version of VSCode that doesn't enable Microsoft trackers by default. Some Microsoft-owned extensions are not available by default, but you can manually install/import them if you already have regular VSCode, you just copy the entire folder and it works with no hitches

### Mobile
- [Aegis Authenticator](https://getaegis.app/) // [Donate (buymeacoffee)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/beemdevelopment) - 2FA authenticator with encrypted backups, automatic backups after each modification
- [AFWall+](https://ukanth.github.io/afwall/) // [Donate (PayPal)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=6E4VZTULRB8GU) - (**root required**) firewall to restrict network access on a per-app basis

- [Cromite](https://github.com/uazo/cromite) - Hardened Chromium browser based on the now-defunct Bromite browser, by uazo, one of the main contributors, with very frequent updates

- [Gboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin) - Arguably the best keyboard on Android, if you like Material You. Blocked all network access via the system settings and AFWall+, Gboard cannot share or upload any personalization data
- [GitHub](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android) - The best GitHub app on mobile, but it could do better, honestly

- [Google Recorder](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-recorder/google-recorder-2-1-347255046-release/) - Use the provided version if you do not have a Google Pixel device. Newer versions of the app WILL NOT WORK properly otherwise! Requires [Speech Recognition and Synthesis from Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.tts) if you want to recognize speech when recording audio
- [hKtweaks](https://github.com/corsicanu/hKtweaks) // [Donate (PayPal)](https://paypal.me/corsicanu) - Kernel manager specifically designed to support Exynos processors. Same functionality as FKM
- [Hypatia](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/us.spotco.malwarescanner/) // [Donate (Divested.dev)](https://divested.dev/pages/donate) - An open-source malware scanner powered by ClamAV-like databases
- [InfoCons] (https://infocons.org/the-infocons-app/) - Free (but seemingly not open-source) app like OpenFoodFacts, but by the InfoCons organization. It's primarily intended to be used in European countries, not in the US
- [KeePassDX](https://www.keepassdx.com/) // [Donate (LiberaPay)](https://liberapay.com/Kunzisoft) - Offline password manager
- [Lawnicons](https://lawnchair.app/downloads/) - Great icon pack that fits the default, Pixel-like icon pack

- [Look4Sat] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rtbishop.look4sat) - Open-source satellite tracker
- [Lucky Patcher](https://www.luckypatchers.com/) - Kind of an obscure one, maybe not used as much these days, but you can patch in-app purchases. It can also patch out ads, trackers and app permissions, and works with root
- [Markdown Editor](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/com.adeeteya.markdown_editor) // [Donate (GitHub Sponsors)](https://github.com/adeeteya/FlutterMarkdownEditor#funding-links-modal-adeeteya-FlutterMarkdownEditor) - Very simple, minimalist, Markdown editor app. I didn't really use it, however, since I don't generally edit or write code, posts on mobile. That might change in the future, who knows
- [MEGA](https://mega.io) - Encrypted storage from a privacy-friendly company
- [Megalodon](https://sk22.github.io/megalodon/) - A Mastodon for Android app fork with an uncertain future. I have moved to Moshidon which is somewhat newer, but still lags behind compared to the upstream.

- [Mint Calculator](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/bored.codebyk.mintcalc/) - A great alternative to the Material You calculator from Google, and it has extra features such as converters
- [Molly](https://molly.im/) - Independent fork of Signal with additional security features, including a few that were removed from Signal. I do NOT use Molly or Signal anymore, simply because they're centralized and require a phone number. Signal is the best when it comes to encryption, but unless they make it federated, or another project comes along to use the Signal protocol in a federated manner, where anyone can have their own Signal server (already possible, but it's [a chore](https://github.com/secure-sign/securesign-setup-guide)), I won't use it. I'll use Matrix for the time being, there's nothing else that I use for 'encrypted' messaging.
- [monocles Chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.monocles.chat/) // [Donate (Monocles.de)](https://monocles.de/more/#donation-section) - XMPP chat client. Gave it a shot, deleted my account a few days later. XMPP isn't *bad*, per se, I just don't want to fragment myself further, that's all. Plus, the app could use a Material 3 facelift.
- [Moshidon](https://github.com/LucasGGamerM/moshidon) - The current Mastodon app I use on Android. Based on Megalodon and the upstream Mastodon for Android app. Seems to lag behind the upstream, and for some reason doesn't implement the QR code sharing feature from upstream, it's just commented out in the code.
- [MRepo](https://github.com/MRepoApp/MRepo/) - Magisk repo and module browser / manager app
- [Mull](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.fennec_dos/) // [Donate (Divested.dev)](https://divested.dev/pages/donate) - Deblobbed, privacy-oriented Firefox browser for Android. **Keep in mind that [Firefox is NOT as secure as Chromium-based browsers](https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html). Use Mulch, Vanadium or Cromite if you want security!**
- [Mulch System WebView](https://divestos.org) // [Donate (Divested.dev)](https://divested.dev/pages/donate) - DivestOS' hardened Chromium system webview, using some of the patches used by GrapheneOS' Vanadium browser
- [NFSee](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.nfc.nfsee/) - Read/dump NFC tag and card data
- [Nothing Recorder](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/nothing-technology-limited/nothing-recorder/nothing-recorder-1-6-0-release/) - Simple, minimalist sound recorder app from Nothing. Microphone options won't do anything unless you have a Nothing device
- [OONI Probe](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.openobservatory.ooniprobe/) // [Donate (OONI.org)](https://ooni.org/donate/) - Run some tests on your network to see if any supported services are blocked or censored by your government
- [OpenFoodFacts](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/openfoodfacts.github.scrachx.openfood/) // [Donate (OpenFoodFacts.org)](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/donate-to-open-food-facts) - Open-source, community-run food information app. You can scan bar codes for known products and get nutritional information, nutritional score, ingredients, eco score (environmental rating), nutritional quality, additive information, ingredient analysis, food processing level, packaging, transportation and more. **This is a must-have!**
- [**OpenVPN for pDNSf**](https://www.zenz-solutions.de/openvpn-for-personaldnsfilter/) // [Donate (PayPal)](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/IZenz) - Allows you to run OpenVPN while using personalDNSfilter as an actual DNS filter, if you have root. **This is a must-have**, in my opinion.
- [OSS Document Scanner](https://apt.izzysoft.de/packages/com.akylas.documentscanner) // [Donate (GitHub Sponsors)](https://github.com/sponsors/farfromrefug) - As the name suggests, it's an open-source document scanner with OCR support
- [**personalDNSfilter**](https://www.zenz-solutions.de/personaldnsfilter-wp/) // [Donate (PayPal)](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/IZenz) - DNS filter proxy app. Allows you to import filterlists (such as [my own](https://github.com/alextecplayz/filterlist)) in order to block certain websites. If you have root, it will run as an actual DNS filter. If you don't, it will use Android's VPN functionality to route everything through the app. **This is a must-have!**
- [Prognoza](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/hr.dtakac.prognoza) // [Donate (LiberaPay)](https://liberapay.com/davidtakac) - Simple, yet insightful FOSS weather app for Android
- [QUIK](https://github.com/octoshrimpy/quik) // [Donate (Patreon)](https://www.patreon.com/octoshrimpy) - Feature-packed FOSS messaging app, fork of the abandoned [QKSMS](https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms)

- [Saber](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.adilhanney.saber/) // [Donate (GitHub Sponsors)](https://github.com/sponsors/adil192) - FOSS note-taking app that supports cloud backups and handwriting, I highly recommend it!
- [Samsung Food](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foodient.whisk) - Has so many cooking recipes, it's insane. It shows nutritional information as well, which is very useful
- [Samsung Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.shealth&hl=en&gl=US) - I can't use the official app because Samsung enforces OneUI, so I use a modified version from [SamsungAppsPatcher](https://adil.hanney.org/SamsungAppsPatcher/) instead
- [Samsung Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.app.notes) - One of the better note-taking apps on Android, with handwriting support
- [Shelter](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.typeblog.shelter/) // [Donate (Patreon)](https://www.patreon.com/PeterCxy) - Takes advantage of the built-in support for work profiles on Android in order to create a new user where you can install separate apps. Helpful if say, you want to run WhatsApp or Instagram on the device, but you want it to be sandboxed and not be able to check your contacts, files, app list from your main profile.
- [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) - Helps apps access highly-privileged APIs without root access. Needed for apps such as aShell You to work without root.
- [SnoopSnitch](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.srlabs.snoopsnitch/) - Open-source app that analyzes your mobile network to check for vulnerabilities, security, and to warn you about potentially fake base stations such as IMSI catchers. Does not work on Android 14, unfortunately, and the latest release's source code is not available - which has led to some believing the app is compromised, do NOT update to the latest (2.0.13) update, just to be sure. **Requires a Qualcomm-based, rooted Android device to work!**
- [Survival Manual](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.ligi.survivalmanual/) - Helpful offline survival manual, provides great tips in case you get stranded somewhere, or the apocalypse happens
- [Telegram FOSS](https://github.com/Telegram-FOSS-Team/Telegram-FOSS) // [Donate (LiberaPay)](https://liberapay.com/Telegram-FOSS/) - FOSS version of the Telegram app. You can't receive your login/sign up verification code as a notification with this app, so make sure you already have Telegram installed (on whatever device) in order to receive your code. **Note that Telegram is insecure (unencrypted) unless you use the Secret Chats feature, which is only available in 1 to 1 DMs. I suggest you don't share any personal or sensitive info through Telegram at all, if possible. The same applies to any other closed-source app such as WhatsApp.**
- [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) // [Donate (termux.dev)](https://termux.dev/en/donate) - VERY useful, however you need to know what you're doing, especially if you grant it root access, otherwise you might brick your device
- [Trail Sense](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.kylecorry.trail_sense/) // [Donate (GitHub Sponsors)](https://github.com/sponsors/kylecorry31) - Spectacular app if you want to travel through the wilderness. It has many useful features, such as beacons, backtrack (step retracing), weather prediction, compass
- [Twine](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/dev.sasikanth.rss.reader) // [Donate (GitHub Sponsors)](https://github.com/sponsors/msasikanth) - RSS reader with Material You, and a bottom bar. I would pick this above Read You, however it does not have an in-app browser, and it has/had lag issues on my Galaxy A10. I don't like that I can't completely stop it from updating the RSS feed altogether, which is either after a certain interval, or when you open the app. *personalDNSfilter* doesn't like this one bit and hits me with an IO error related to a Socket Timeout exception.
- [ViMusic](https://f-droid.org/packages/it.vfsfitvnm.vimusic/) - FOSS YouTube Music frontend with no account support
- [Warden](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AppWarden) // [Donate (GitLab)](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AppWarden#support-developement) - Get local statistics on what trackers and loggers the apps installed on your device use, similar to Exodus
- [WebApps](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.tobykurien.webapps/) - Turn any site into a sandboxed PWA. I use this heavily, as I have multiple PWAs for documentation related to CMake, DirectX, MDN, Meson, OpenGL and Vulkan, PWAs like ADS-B Exchange, Coinranking and Periodex. **WebApps is [deprecated](https://github.com/tobykurien/WebApps/issues/253) and cannot guarantee security or privacy, use it at your own risk**
