## Review TLDR
I say this with a heavy heart, but Scrap Mechanic's development is really painfully slow even though it's been 6 years in Early Access. The game engine they use isn't optimized properly, or can't simply process everything without some lag. The multiplayer experience is down bad, unless you're playing over LAN or you have fast Internet speed, you will experience stutters, net lag, and other similar issues, which can degrade your experience.

## Modding
Scrap Mechanic isn't that modder-friendly. Apart from your own custom creations on the Steam Workshop, a few code changes and tweaks here and there, and some texture swaps, you can't really mod the game further. Stuff like adding extra hotbars, settings and much more are in the dev-accessible source code, which the public cannot access, yet. It remains to be seen if Axolot will give us this possibility in the future.

## Updates
With a big Challenge Mode overhaul coming in May 2022, and in Q3/Q4 2022 Chapter Two for Survival, the game's updates are... lacking, and it takes months before you can get a small sneak peek at what's coming in the future. It took a long time for the game to get the Survival Mode, which isn't even complete. Some things shown in the trailer are scripted or missing from the current game. Floating boats in Survival? Missing, unless you use "Dev Mode" to get access to the Creative-like parts menu, from where you can build using Creative-only assets that do float. Even without the "Dev Mode" trick, your boat will sink pretty fast, as there's no water physics. Aerodynamics? Missing, but the developers say it's on their list. That remains to be seen.

Do not buy this game if you expect fast, monthly or almost monthly updates. You won't get those.

## The Game Engine
Instead of using a reliable, current-gen game engine like Unreal, or Unity, which support most or all of the things they try to add (aerodynamics - partial support, water physics, advanced physics etc.), among access to technology like Lumen (UE5 only), that could improve the graphics and the performance, they choose to go with what they claim is their own, custom-built game engine. That is not feasible for a 12-developer team that has to work BOTH on the game, and the engine. Custom engines are mostly made by big, AAA studios that have years of programming experience, well-accustomed programmers and a big budget, because making a game engine is a costly, lengthy and intricate process.

It will always be a horrible idea to develop your own game engine if you're a solo dev or you have a small developer team that can help you, and if your budget is basically peanuts. Do NOT do it, there's already better engines out there.

The engine's performance is questionable most of the time, with crashes and performance issues being pretty common if you like using massive creations. This engine cannot even run properly on NVIDIA RTX 3000 series cards without some frame drops, it's that unoptimized and bad. It cannot withstand huge creations or creations that aren't welded to the ground.

## Platform Support
Currently, Scrap Mechanic has native support for PCs running Windows. Linux players will have to run this game through Steam Play, using Proton or Proton GE, and should expect decreased performance compared to native Windows. I have made a comparison from my PC using a GTX 1650, 8 GBs of RAM and an I7, on both Windows and Ubuntu. Windows had a difference of +40 to even +80 FPS above the Ubuntu version, that with Proton GE and FSR could not manage above 60 FPS, and had constant stutters, on Medium settings.

The Steam Deck runs Scrap Mechanic through Steam Play as well, and you may need a keyboard if the Deck can't mimic a keyboard with the controller. According to ProtonDB, the game has a Silver rating, but you have to tinker with the controls.

There is no console support for Scrap Mechanic yet, and I don't expect them being able to support this. There is also no native controller support. You can emulate the controller through Steam or Steam Big Picture, but the game doesn't support them natively.

## Creative Mode
Creative Mode is, for the most part, fun. I have significantly enjoyed Creative Mode more than Survival Mode, due to the Workshop and the big number of items accessible.

It can get boring, though. In my 224 hours of playing SM, I have gotten bored with Creative Mode occasionally.

## Survival Mode
Survival Mode is pretty bland. The player constantly needs to fill its Thirst and Hunger bars, otherwise it will start moaning due to thirst and hunger, every few seconds until you either start losing health and finally you die, or until you refill those needs, at least until ~40% of the bar is full.

The enemies are somewhat challenging if you're maybe half-asleep. There's some big balancing issues that have not been resolved yet: the Tapebots. They can kill the player with 2 shots of tape, which is way too overpowered. They have a pretty big range, and they're somewhat similar to aggressive snipers.

## Challenge Mode
Challenge Mode is pretty good, although I never had enough time or creativity to create any Challenge Packs. You can download and play Challenges from the Steam Workshop, some of them are wonderful, and fun.

## Character customization
You can unlock cosmetics during gameplay, when you find Garment packs of different rarities, which need to be then placed in a Dressbot alongside cotton, to create the garments.

There are no microtransactions, thankfully.

Notice The clothing unlocks you get aren't synced to the Steam Cloud, so if you want to transfer your progress, you will have to copy the files from one device to another. This should be easily fixable by the devs.

## Anticheat/DRM
The game uses a custom DRM that prohibits you from playing the game if you're offline.

This is extremely annoying if your Internet provider, or you have no Internet connection. I do not understand why they added this DRM in the first place, it's not like it has anything to protect. It's a simple indie game that's been 6 years in Early Access, with barely anything, not a AAA-level game with a boatload of content. Steamworks DRM should be more than enough for this game.

Notice You MUST start the game while connected to the Internet. Afterwards, you can disconnect and still be able to play, but you'll have to do this every time you start the game.

## Dedicated Servers
There are no dedicated servers, the multiplayer is Peer-To-Peer, AKA the worst kind of multiplayer you can have. There are no plans to open any dedicated servers, and there are no tools to create a dedicated server. It's pretty simple to make a dedicated machine that runs a SM world: Download the game, launch, open the world you want to be open all the time and simply invite some friends, or from a different machine right click on the Steam username that is running SM and click Join Game.

## Early Access for 6 years and still going...
I'm baffled that this is even possible, with barely any development. Chapter Two in particular, has been in development for almost 2 years.

## Conclusion:
If you play this with an Internet connection, KB&M, single-player, on either Creative Mode or Survival Mode, you could get a decent time with the game.

If you are looking for an excellent multiplayer experience, controller support, good performance, no stupid DRM, this is not the game for you. Purchase Brick Rigs instead.

My review will be still Not recommended. I do not recommend you buy this game. I haven't really been pleased with it, from both a gamer and a game developer perspective.
