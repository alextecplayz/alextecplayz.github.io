## Trump kisses a (possibly underage) model on a boat in 1991

*"From magical New York, glamorous Plaza Hotel, Elite Model Management presents the '1991 Look of the Year' contest"*, opens a [54-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_LmdTa3758) in which a younger, less orange, and slightly more eloquent and less prone to derailing from the topic at hand, Donald Trump (aged 45), as a judge, is one of the judges. It's a contest in which 58 women (minors included) participate for over $700,000 worth of prizes and the ""prestigious"" 'Look of the Year' title.

It's a deeply creepy yearly event since 1983, in which some of the contestants are minors. The women introduced at [1:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_LmdTa3758&t=94s), notable contestants from past editions are, [as per a YouTube comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_LmdTa3758&lc=UgxIL7H2SNGIb_VciWd4AaABAg), minors. Stephanie Seymour, born in 1968, was 15 years old in 1983. Karin Hunter Reno, born 1968, was also 15. Maria Lindkvist, born 1972, was 15 in 1987, and Cindy Crawford, born 1966, was 17 in 1983. And this doesn't get better. The [Wikipedia section on the titleholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Model_Look#Titleholders) (winners of editions) mentions the ages of the participants as well, which helped me perform some statistics below:

| Age           | Count of winning contestants matching age |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| 14            | 6          |
| 15            | 15         |
| 16            | 6          |
| 17            | 9          |
| 18            | 5          |
| 19            | 3          |
| 20            | 3          |
| 21            | 2          |
| 23            | 2          |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Average age   | 16.53      |
| Median age    | 16         |
| Highest count | 15, age 15 |

As I've mentioned on Mastodon, I've found this video, and I wanted to dig in to see who is the [woman in this photo](https://techhub.social/@DemocracyMattersALot@mstdn.social/114868422421393200). At that time I concluded that the top half of the photo is, at the very least, real, as the image is present in The Guardian's [article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/14/teen-models-powerful-men-when-donald-trump-hosted-look-of-the-year). She seems to be [Belinda Hutter](https://youtu.be/2_LmdTa3758?feature=shared&t=508) from Lochau, Austria. It can be assumed that she is a minor, based on her appearance alongisde Tamara Sedmark, a 15-year old girl, where at [18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_LmdTa3758&t=1124s), the narrator introduces her, and the cameraman leans in for an **upskirt photo** and close-up shots, minutes later.

        </div>
    </figure>
</div>

Unfortunately, it's not specified during the video if she is a minor or not, and I'm obviously not going to dig any further, since there's nothing that shows up when you look up her name via a search engine. Either way, even if Trump may have not kissed Belinda on the mouth but rather on the cheek, it's still turbo-fucking-creepy, considering he was 45 and she was most probably a fucking minor! Put him in a cage!

This whole fucking show is creepy as fuck; it's actually crazy to watch this on YouTube. I like how Trump is described by the host of the show as the "best known personality of the city of New York and probably in the United States, and our host here at the Plaza since he owns the place, the president of the Trump organization".

And fucking David Copperfield, the magician, is also attending as a judge — someone that has had multiple sexual assault allegations throughout the years and was an associate of Jeffrey Epstein, having even attended a dinner at his house in 2004, in which he asked a woman (Johanna Sjoberg, who later accused Epstein of abusing her) if she "was aware that girls were getting paid to find other girls", seemingly out of "concern" for her, according to Copperfield's lawyers. He met Epstein at least three times and called or left messages for Epstein about a dozen times between 2004 and 2005.

By 14:40, we see how the judgments and 'appraisal' work. Wearing only a bikini and a thong and holding a folder, each contestant goes in a room where the judges are, gives them the folder, and the judges "discover what makes each one special", and "Each girl was considered not only for her beauty and poise, but also for her personality and that indefinable something extra that makes a 'top model'". And then the judges argue between themselves, as they need to choose the 21 finalists. Trump is seen at [15:57 quietly reading out of a dossier](https://youtu.be/2_LmdTa3758?feature=shared&t=957).

During the show, the camera is often pointed towards women's asses in swimsuits.

But back at the second half of the [image](https://files.techhub.social/cache/media_attachments/files/114/868/422/351/722/359/original/498a5e3399cb8594.jpg) I mentioned at the beginning. Is the image real? I *strongly* believe it is, and here's why: in The Guardian's [first image](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c37949875c04912789569901f8ef9654513eb14e/93_299_8923_5358/master/8923.jpg?width=1900&dpr=2&s=none&crop=none), Trump is shaking her hand, while in [the second](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1a582803c3bcc591986a226f62a55440e1796af/0_534_8907_5344/master/8907.jpg?width=1900&dpr=2&s=none&crop=none), Belinda Hutter is likely leaning in to tell him something, after which the kiss could have occurred — although I don't see it as a kiss on the mouth, but on the cheek, seeing as how the other judges greeting or congratulating contestants did the same — not uncommon, but still, I find it a little creepy.

Personally, I believe that if you're an adult and the minor is not a relative of yours, then you shouldn't kiss them on the cheek as a greeting. Just a handshake should be enough. And these contests, beauty parlors, or 'fashion shows' or whatever Look of the Year is supposed to be, should not allow minors as contestants at all. But that's just me.

I mean, have we learned anything about these contests? The judges take advantage of their power as judges, telling the contestants that if they don't do this or that, they they can disqualify them, change their rating, etc. Opportunistic old, white men (and women, but predominantly the jury was formed of men) exploiting people, taking advantage of them. It's no surprise that sexual abuse allegations have arisen from Look of the Year contests throughout its existence. The contestants may be desperate to attempt to win or get ahead of the others in competitions like these, and if minors are involved, this makes things significantly worse.

So, mission solved? Trump is very slightly — if at all — creepy in the footage available from the 1991 show.

## New Trump letter to Epstein surfaces

On July 17, the [Wall Street Journal publishes an exclusive article](https://archive.is/20250718135326/https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796) outlining Epstein's 50th birthday preparations by Ghislaine Maxwell, reaching out to Epstein's family and friends, including Trump. She collected letters for a 2003 birthday album.

And before I continue with that, I also need to mention that [Trump lashed out at his own MAGA cultists](https://archive.is/o/vcuCx/https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-jeffrey-epstein-files-supporters-4021019d), calling them "PAST supporters" that have "bought into this 'bull-[shit]', hook, line, and sinker", and that he doesn't "want their support anymore!", I'm sure this won't bite him in the ass soon enough...

Back to the letter. According to the WSJ, the letter reviewed by the Journal is bawdy, containing several lines of typewritten text framed by the seemingly hand-drawn outline of a naked woman with a marker. Small arcs define the breasts, and below her waist is a squiggly "Donald" mimicking pubic hair. Inside this outline is a note styled as a third-person imaginary conversation between Trump and Epstein, which I simply must share:

> **Voice Over:** There must be more to life than having everything\
> **Donald:** Yes, there is, but I won’t tell you what it is.\
> **Jeffrey:** Nor will I, since I also know what it is.\
> **Donald:** We have certain things in common, Jeffrey.\
> **Jeffrey:** Yes, we do, come to think of it.\
> **Donald:** Enigmas never age, have you noticed that?\
> **Jeffrey:** As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you.\
> **Trump:** A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.

Of course, Trump vehemently denies that the letter was written by him and blames the Democrats and WSJ for writing a fake letter. Not an unexpected reaction, at this point. Soon after, [he filed a $10bn lawsuit against WSJ's owner, Rupert Murdoch, and his company, Dow Jones](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23g5xpggzmo), over the publication of the aforementioned article. A spokesperson for Dow Jones said that they will "vigorously defend against" the lawsuit.

I do not want to speculate on what Trump and Epstein "have in common" because that's a never-ending rabbit hole of allegations.

And all of this comes after two days ago, July 17, when Trump ordered [Pam Bondi](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w1014rlq9o) and the Justice Department to produce additional documents related to Epstein, namely the grand jury testimony. We'll see if this actually materializes, because such testimony can include confidential informants, whose identities are protected for their own safety. Materials in a grand jury testimony are usually kept secret under the law, but a judge can unseal the documents if they deem that there is sufficient public interest and that it outweighs the need for these legal protections in the case.

Meanwhile, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress are attempting to push a petition that would force Bondi to release many more materials pertaining to Epstein. It's rare to see both sides to come together and unite forces, but if it helps kick Trump off his high chair, and hopefully in a cell in the graybar hotel, it's fine by me.

A [catchy, AI-generated jazz song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELJhKli-dmk) also explains the history of the Epstein files and pokes fun at Trump. Great use of AI, imo.

## Telegram doesn't stop licking Putin in the ass

According to [Russian Government-owned](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russian-news-agency-tass/) news agency [TASS](https://tass.com/economy/1990783), Telegram is opening a representative office in Russia in order to comply with [Roskomnadzor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roskomnadzor), the Russian federal agency responsible for monitoring, controlling, and censoring mass media in Russia.

This comes off as Telegram and Durov bowing down to Putin, because it was an unnecessary move, considering the fact that [Roskomnadzor gave up trying to block Telegram in the mid-2020s, as Roskomnadzor itself and other government structures have set up their own channels in the app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roskomnadzor#Telegram). As a reminder of Durov's political shift towards libertarianism and pro-Trump/pro-Putinism, back in 2014 he was fired from VKontakte (the Russian equivalent of Facebook), claiming to have been ousted by pro-Putin executives angered by his refusal to hand user data over to the government. And now in 2025, he's back to sucking off Putin.

> *And a reminder that Telegram is not end-to-end encrypted, unless you use the opt-in feature, Secret Chats. All other conversations, including direct messages and groups, use simple, server-side security, which means (and has already been proven) that Telegram can and WILL turn over any data to government agencies, despite Durov's claims that he won't censor things, and so on. Fucking avoid Telegram like the plague, and help your friends and family that use that wretched app to move to something else - preferably Signal or at the very least, WhatsApp, which does use E2EE, in all situations! **Telegram is not a private messenger app, never has been!***

## The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is shutting down May 2026

After 33 years since its first episode was aired, CBS has announced that the Late Show will shut down next year. Of course, Trump was [immediately giddy](https://mastodon.social/@randahl/114880311626682376), the rotten, seedless orange that he is.

CBS says it's purely a financial reason and isn't related to the show's performance. Still, some allege that Paramount, CBS' parent company, amid talks between Paramount and Skydance Media to merge the two together - a move that would require approval from the US government, ended the show for political reasons, because Colbert has constantly criticized Trump since he took over in 2015. This, and the recently settled lawsuit between Paramount and Trump due to a CBS interview with Kamala Harris, with Trump alleging that they edited an interview to favour the Democratic party.

## Anti-woke dad fled with family to Russia, gets sent to the war

According to [The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/texan-moved-fam-to-russia-to-flee-wokenow-hes-headed-to-ukraine-front-line/), Derek Huffman joined the military hoping to become a Russian citizen, and fled Texas with his family to avoid ["LGBTQ+ indoctrination" for his kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTCnjNTWqA). Little did he know that Russia isn't the woke-free paradise he thought it would be, as he was sent to the front line after being assured that he would serve in a non-combat role such as a welder or correspondent.

Okay, focusing a little on their reason to move, the kids' mother says in the video that they grow up too fast, and they want to keep them innocent for as long as possible, to "enjoy their childhood and the lives that we[they] have". I can assure you, that the shows and stuff displayed on the screen to support their claims, will not make their childhood any less enjoyable.

As a child, you don't really give a fuck about gender identity, attraction, and what have you, because you're too focused on playing with toys, reading books, going out with your friends. But at the same time, this doesn't mean that you can't also learn new things and respect people for who they are. I wasn't particularly 'woke' when I was young.

But I wasn't homophobic in any way; I never paid attention to who people liked, as long as it wasn't illegal, like pedophilia, incest, and so on.

Your kids can grow up to be wonderful, warm, embracing, and open, instead of growing up indoctrinated in Russian propaganda about how Russia is the best, how the West is falling to degeneracy, and so on, growing up to be hateful, cold, and if they ever have a change of heart and become 'woke', they will resent you for trying to raise them in a way that doesn't represent them or their needs.

> “The point of this act for me is to earn a place here in Russia,” he told Russian state media last month. “If I risk myself for our new country, no one will say that I am not a part of it. Unlike migrants in America who come there just like that, do not assimilate, and at the same time want free handouts.” (The Daily Beast)\
> DeAnna, 42, suggested her husband had been misled during the military recruiting process. She added that, after a month of service, her family had yet to receive any pay.\
> “When he signed up and had all of that done, he was told he would not be training for two weeks and going straight to the front lines,” she said. “But it seems as though he is getting one more week of training, closer to the front lines, and then they are going to put him on the front lines.”

It may come as a shock to Derek and his wife, but what they're experiencing right now is EXACTLY the same thing that can and does happen to immigrants (documented or undocumented) in the US and other countries. They come to a country, think it'll be better for them and their family, that their lives will improve, that they will live the American dream, and then they're forced into a shitty job, scrubbing toilets, mopping up shit, piss, and vomit in some dirty stalls for some failing local diner, or maybe a more respectable job.

But in both cases, the owners are greedy, dirty, racist fucking pigs that take their passports and ID away, hold them hostage this way, and perhaps even skim off from their salaries - or not even pay them for their work, forcing the immigrants to find other ways to provide food for their families.

This is exactly what happens when you let right-wing racists, xenophobes, and general lunatics with deeply anti-immigration views run the country or (re)write laws. Through corruption, law enforcement may also be less inclined to help and will instead be more violent towards them, creating a perpetual cycle of hopelessness. All of this could have been avoided.

And here they are now, in Russia. An anti-immigration policy by Putin and his cronies, a heavily right-wing, almost fully dictatorial policy and regime. This is where Derek and his family are the immigrant family moving to Russia thinking that they will escape 'the Woke™', that their lives will be so much better living as a "traditional family", they will live the Russian dream, walking down the streets of Moscow, in a never-ending honeymoon. In comes the Russian military, totally, definitely, *certainly* incorruptible, with no history of mistreatment of its own staff, not paying Derek his fair share of pay for a fair day's work. You are the miserable, hopeless immigrants now. And I feel sorry, mostly for your girls and the dog (*although the dog, a Husky, could be much better off in Russia, especially northern parts, compared to scorching Texas*) than you, since they're kids and they probably had no say in the matter.

Oh hoh, you're *winning* so much! You're *winning*, aren't you? You're living the perfect traditional Russian dream, aren't you? God, you're so *winning* right now. Imagine how much the gender libruls are crying because you left the US! They lost, you *won*! You're so *winning*!

(*inb4 Derek flees the war zone, retreats back home to his village, and gets called a traitor or defector and either gets tortured or killed for this, or gets killed in the 'special operation'*)

That's all for this article. I need to sleep.
