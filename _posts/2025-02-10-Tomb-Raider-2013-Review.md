## TLDR
A painfully generic reboot that's needlessly gory and brutal, questionable DLC practices and boring challenges to attain 100% completion. The story is mediocre, the environments are interesting and the parkour could have been more refined. There are more minor gripes as well. Would I recommend this? Not really, no.


**SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!**

I'll start with this: the core of the game is good. There's enough there to call Tomb Raider (2013) a compelling purchase if you like exploring every nook and cranny for ammo, scrap and XP. It has a nice skill and weapon upgrade system, which involves collecting 3 weapon parts to unlock a new 'stage' which adds 1 new possible upgrade for that weapon. The 4-weapon system (Bow, Pistol, Rifle, Shotgun) is also great, because you don't really need anything else, realistically, in most games that allow you to use firearms. You can also melee enemies after mastering some skills, including "brutal" takedowns and dodging.

But then comes (I assume) Square Enix, and shoves purchasable DLC that allows you to buy some of these weapon upgrades (animal instinct, agility skill, headshot reticle, pistol burst, pistol silencer) for $1 *each* which is boneheaded and utterly absurd. Then again, this is Square Enix we're talking about, a company so utterly miserable, greedy and abhorrent in microtransactions, that I'm surprised they aren't selling each strand of hair from Lara's head for a buck each, because I'm sure they would. This company is built on pay-to-win and nickel-and-diming players using shoddy DLC. Heck, I'd think that the board is cursed or something, so they're forced to push this DLC otherwise they'd all catch fire as if they were vampires or something.

The story itself is...underwhelming. It has a good skeleton with the crash on the island, all of the attempts to escape, etc., but it's all so dumb and I'm genuinely surprised that by the end Lara is still alive, considering the amount of falls, crashes and jumps in cutscenes where she might realistically have broken her limbs otherwise or something. But nah, she just magically heals or finds some medkit and all is well again until the next time this happens. Seriously, I would've half expected her to become the female version of Solid Snake, with an eye patch and/or some scars and long-term wounds on her body by the time we reach the finale of this game. Nothing really stands out as memorable, I'm sorry to say. All of the supporting characters are painfully generic and unmemorable, and any of them dying at some point does nothing for me. Heck, I expected like half of them to die by the time we reach 75% of the story. All of the bosses suck, have no personality and no time to develop. The 'big bad' Mattias is painfully stupid and the boss fight is close to non-existent.

Add on top of this, dreadfully boring and butt-soring challenges involving finding 5 egg nests, 5 hanging sun targets, 10 hanging skull targets, some banners to burn, 75 fucking GPS caches, dozens of artifacts and dozens more documents, and you'll wish you've uninstalled the game. It's too much crap that doesn't need to exist. Why does Lara need to find 5 egg nests? What is she going to do with so many damn eggs? Where would she put them anyway, since her player model doesn't have a bag or satchel? Why not steal a photo camera and photograph one egg nest conveniently placed in a position you couldn't miss when climbing up a waterfall, instead of throwing them on roofs and hidden nooks and crannies where the sun doesn't shine? Why bother shooting the stupid hanging targets, some of which are placed in literal corners of the map that probably the majority of people would never explore? Most of this shit, you'd have to use Instinct Mode to find them. It's unnecessary padding for a linear game that doesn't really need this. Get these out, and it's already a big improvement.

The gore, the brutality in this game is another major gripe for me. Gore isn't an issue personally, I've played games that would be considered gory in some aspects, but Tomb Raider is needlessly, unnecessarily gory and brutal in this regard! Every significant death scene in this game - falling in the water and hitting her head on the rocks before hitting rock bottom, getting impaled by multiple objects including traps, breakable (using the shotgun) spike traps, boss weapons, falling to her death by jumping from a too high place, getting mauled by a wolf, brutally getting shot in the face / eye / head, it's all so fucking over-the-top and unnecessary! For fuck's sake, Tomb Raider (and Lara Croft as a *franchise* altogether, I'd bet) isn't supposed to be like this! This is mainly why this game has an ESRB rating of Mature 17+. There's so much blood as well, pools of blood and skulls all over the place as if this is DOOM (2016), but on an ancient island from 3rd century Japan.

Character movement is alright. One problem with this is that you can't forcefully crouch. Lara will crouch only in specific situations such as when crawling or when trying to hide from enemies behind cover. Why? Why not let us crouch whenever we want? This would unlock some more combat possibilities, because close quarters combat in this game is...bad. The final boss fight, you have to keep your distance and run around in circles around the damn thing because otherwise it's a two-hit death (thank fuck they have stages, and the game saves between them). There's also the parkour, jumping, hanging from cliffs, climbing rocks, mountain sides, etc. It's clunky. You can't hold `W` + `D` and expect to jump right, Lara will jump up instead, making you miss the jump and fall to your death in some cases. Movement in certain chase sequences is also bad. You hold `W` to run forward, then a cutscene plays, then the camera switches to face Lara running towards the camera, and you have to press `S` instead.

The graphics are alright. This game probably runs on a potato, it's not very graphically demanding, my GTX 1650 can run this completely maxed out with no issue. 3GB RAM usage on Linux and 0.7GB VRAM (up to 1.2GB VRAM if you keep switching between graphical settings). The game outright refused to run on Linux (using the native version), so I used Proton Experimental instead, which netted some weird stuttering in some portions of the map (not due to shader compilation) that simply wouldn't go away. When launching the game, you'll see some flickering while the intro titles play out. Holding the brightness slider in the main menu settings screen will pretty much freeze everything on the screen until you let it go, including the water funnily enough. The game is incredibly dark even when using the maximum brightness setting, which means you'll squint and lean forward to look closer at what's going on the screen in portions of the game, such as forests. The game is deeply lacking saturation of any kind, it gets very quickly fatiguing and boring to play, as an effect.

One thing I can praise are the environments and locations themselves. They're varied and interesting. Throughout the story, Lara explores forests, a village, a shantytown, a beach, bunkers, abandoned labs, a mountain radio tower and outpost, and a Japanese temple. They all look great, given the graphics of the game.

The 3D menus suck ass, they're unnecessary and the mouse cursor isn't always visible or centered, so you have to wiggle your mouse across the screen to find it. You can use the arrows (`UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`) to navigate the menus as well, but not `WASD`, which is frustrating when using the fast travel map. You also can't hold down the keys to quickly change the selected fast travel point, you manually have to click the one you want, or keep pressing `LEFT` and `RIGHT` to find it if you don't use the mouse.

Some more nitpicking:
- the animations are jittery. In the cutscene where Lara finds her first camp, her movements are super jittery and the camera is shaky as hell. I don't know why this happens, but it's very jarring.
- Some jumps (e.g. jumping to reach a rope to slide on) have very little leeway / very small buffer zones, so unless you press jump at the right moment, you'll most likely fall to your death.
- This is bizarre, because Lara herself has some CRAZY homing skills to reach certain elements that are farther or moving, such as cliff edges, any ledge you can hang on, bars she uses to launch herself, etc.
- Then, they introduce the feature where Lara can jump from one rope to another while descending, which *should* let the player experiment further with this, but the very few moments this feature even exists, the camera moves into a cinematic mode where you just have to let Lara do it herself (e.g on the beach when returning from a bunker), and pressing `SHIFT` in such cutscenes would make Lara fall to her death because of this, as you're not aware if it's a cutscene or something else.
- There's a boss enemy on a certain ship near the end of the game portion, where you're stuck in a takedown stage where you MUST perform the takedown properly, or you'll keep repeating this sequence to no end, without being able to actually kill the boss. I've wasted 20 pistol ammo on the fucking guy before I managed to realize this.
- Boss takedowns are utter fucking garbage. You have to wait until the moving circle actually reaches the inner circle before pressing `F`, or you'll fail the takedown - hence why in the boss mentioned above, you'll just repeat the fight over and over again without realizing this.
- Moment-to-moment, Telltale-esque quick time event combos, takedowns SUCK. ASS! This is one of the biggest gripes I have with the core of the game. QTE events in this game are unbelievably short and sometimes you might not even have time to react, or to read the (delayed) subtitle that tells you what key to press, which will make you fail a boss, an enemy takedown, or as mentioned twice already above, endlessly repeating a boss fight.

I have nothing to say about the Multiplayer mode. They infected it using Epic Online Services in the latest patch but fortunately you can roll back using the Beta tab on Steam to build 743.0. I haven't played anything in MP, and have no plans to do so anyway, since I uninstalled the game as soon as I completed it.

I've 100%-ed the singleplayer, spent 16.2 hours to achieve this, and I'm dropping it in my Completed / Won't Play / Dropped category on Steam. I don't think I'll replay this again, there's no reason to. I'm genuinely surprised the amounts of good reviews this game has, and the critic reviews that are 100s and 90s across the board, while ignoring all of this shit that drag it down to a miserable 6 or 7/10. There's nothing "exciting", "beautifully presented" ([IGN Review](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/25/tomb-raider-review-2)) of the game), there's no "great characterization", nothing "amazing" and there's very little, and very unrealistic character development for Lara. I find it hard to believe she becomes a hardened survivor literal DAYS after arriving on the island. No one can evolve that quickly, realistically.

Add to that, the disparity between the cutscenes and moments that are meant to make Lara seem scared to even try and kill an enemy, and the actions of the player, where you can brutally takedown enemies, mash the pick in the head of a boss's skull, and the weapons provided (shotgun, rifle), with Lara easily wielding these weapons with very little recoil and no reaction to killing the enemies? Lara in cutscenes? Waah! Struggling to fend of an attacker, being uncomfortable holding her pistol. Lara in a gunfight? Using a shotgun in close quarters to one-shot kill an enemy with no hesitation whatsoever, and then in the final boss fight, repeatedly firing bullets from two pistols into Mattias without a care in the world. At least if the game had some kind of progress in this department, from the beginning where Lara would wield these weapons with somewhat of a care and doubt about using them, to becoming a hardened killer by the end. You can't avoid the conflict, unlike some reviewer mentioned in their review. Either way, using a bow and arrows, using the pick or weapons, you cannot progress through certain moments without killing everyone. And it's terribly absurd as well, Lara taking on an army of armored Japanese guards using a bow and arrow (I literally did that in my latest playthrough!) seems so unrealistic to me.

I genuinely find it hard to believe some of the critic reviews for this game aren't paid, or the reviewers simply haven't played any other game in their life beyond Pac-Man, because Tomb Raider (2013) is painfully generic and more akin to a third-person shooter than a Tomb Raider game. Heck, it's a Dollar Store version of Indiana Jones or some Uncharted game. It really is unmemorable and I'll probably forget all about this game in a matter of a few days. Don't buy it unless it's on a sale, if you really want to play.

The verdict? Shit game, don't bother.
