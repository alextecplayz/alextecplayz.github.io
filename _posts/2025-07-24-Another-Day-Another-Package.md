I've wanted to write about Romania's politics, incompetency, general lies, and so much more for two years now, but I never got around to it. Hopefully now I can, because some of this shit might just surprise you, as Romania is supposed to be a 'European' country, part of NATO and whatnot.

But before that...

## Collective Shout is a puritan Christo-fascist organisation

Itch.Io had a game that was temporarily available for sale called '*No Mercy*', some shitty 3D game that is 'not a rape simulator' according to the developers' site, which was banned back in April.

Still, after that, an organisation called [Collective Shout](https://www.collectiveshout.org/) launched a [campaign against Steam and Itch](https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors) asking major global payment processors to bully (force, strong-arm) Steam and Itch into banning certain types of games, and make them follow some new guidelines for what they can and can't sell via these processors.

Itch so nicely clarifies that it's a critical time for the platform as in order for it to literally fucking survive, and to continue operating a marketplace for developers of all kinds, they had to comply as soon as possible and resorted to delisting all NSFW games - they will review the NSFW content, conduct a comprehensive audit and then introduce new guidelines to ensure creators match the criteria that the payment processors allow, in order to sell their products.

Of course, *of course*, bumbling fucks all over Itch, Steam discussions, Mastodon, Twitter and reddit accused Itch of throwing queer people under the bus, and other knee-jerk, mouth-breather responses without even taking 2 minutes to [read their fucking blog post](https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content). Read, asswipes, read!

Okay, so what happened? Who is this Collective Shout organization? The founder behind the org, Melinda Tankard Reist, describes herself as a "pro-life feminist" (she's pro-church, anti-trans, anti-abortion, and has written for multiple Christian conservative newspapers - she's a TERF and a Christofascist). She does have a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melinda_Tankard_Reist), and boy howdy is it fucking abysmal! She's basically the TERFy version of [Jack Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Thompson_(activist)), famously known for wanting to sue Rockstar for each game they released, because he's another puritan fuckwad that thinks rap music and video games are obscene.

Take-Two got sick of his ass back in 2007, when they filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction against Thompson from filing any more actions against the company, alleging that the lawsuits violated the company's First Amendment rights.

Of course, Thompson despite settling the suit a month later, made more threats and accusations, and in 2008 he went full-on schizo r-d mode. He called GTA IV "the gravest assault upon children in this country since polio", and even sent a letter to Strauss Zelnick's attorney, addressed to Zelnick's mother, accusing her son of "doing everything he possibly can to sell as many copies of GTA:IV to teen boys in the United States, a country in which your son claims you raised him to be 'a Boy Scout'. ... More like the Hitler Youth, I would say." - absolutely fucking rancid letter, how can one be so possibly demented and hardcore against a game to compare it to the literal Hitler Youth. Absolute scumbag human being.

Thankfully, he was permanently disbarred in 2008 by the Supreme Court of Florida for making false statements to tribunals, humiliating litigants, and inappropriate conduct. Fuck you, Thompson!

She wrote some papers: [Giving sorrow words: women's stories of grief after abortion](https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9781875989676&redir_esc=y) - in which the book contains stories of a dozen women that regret their abortions; [Defiant birth: women who resist medical eugenics](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL48211468M/Defiant_Birth), because apparently women should forcefully bring children into this world knowing full well that they might have proper disabilities and health issues. Personally, it isn't eugenics if it means not bringing into this world a child that will suffer for the rest of their life, simply because someone values all life. You don't need some perfect child, but would you want to give birth to a child that will endlessly suffer? Is it really worth it?; and a couple more stuff, related to 'challenging the sexualisation of girls', 'exposing the harms of the global pornography industry', and 'stories of survival in the sex trade' - maybe because sex work doesn't have all of the rights other jobs do, due to Christian conservative lobbyists that still view this work as 'not a real job'!

She led a successful campaign to block Tyler, the Creator from touring in Australia due to lyrics she considered misogynistic. She tried to have SnoopDogg's visa revoked by stating that his lyrics "glorify violence against women which puts all women in danger", and also campaigned for Eminem to be banned from Australia. What the *fuck* is wrong with you?

The org posted a [rambling article](https://www.collectiveshout.org/high-level-ndity-honey-birdette-upheld) about Honey Birdette posters that are "porn-themed", because apparently advertising lingerie in stores MUST be porn or indecent! And a post on [asking Twitter to ban porn](https://www.collectiveshout.org/ban-prn-on-x) entirely, because Heaven forbid parents control their children's access to social media. No, apparently the blame doesn't fall on the parents, and therefore, we must implement rules in which we request IDs and whatnot from people to verify their age - a blatant privacy nightmare for everyone.

Also shitting on [OnlyFans](https://www.collectiveshout.org/call_on_the_us_attorney_general_investigate_onlyfans), reddit (which, fair enough, reddit IS a shithole), but at least they do have like two articles which make sense - Temu selling [child-like dolls](https://www.collectiveshout.org/child_s_x_abuse_dolls_on_temu) for sex, and then how [sellers get around these restrictions](https://www.collectiveshout.org/how-temu-sellers-get-around-doll-restrictions). Very rational stuff, you can find this stuff on AliExpress and other sites as well, it's at the very least utterly fucking creepy - something that actually makes sense, something that can and should protect children, and discourage child attraction and abuse!

But this is precisely WHY Collective Shout is dangerous. Because just like fascists and other extreme (both far-left and far-right in equal measures) ideologies, they bring some fair points, just before shoving down your throat their extremist, puritan views! The fact that the payment processors actually joined up with CS on their crusade against rational stuff like rape and incest raises some critical questions about the future, and opens up an *extremely dangerous* precedent for banning things that some groups of people (e.g. hardcore Christians in this case) don't agree with!

Just like I said, today it's about banning incest and rape games, tomorrow it'll be banning LGBTQ+ games, general porn games that don't contain their so-called 'harmful' tropes like objectification, and before you know it, by next week all games on Steam and Itch will be promoting [[:donaldtrump:Daddy Trump]] and his lackeys, and the puritan American way of life, holding a bible, performing exorcisms (*not the first or the last mention of exorcism in this post, by the way!*), owning the liberals and other US-centric propaganda.

Her whole ass organization is pulling a "won't somebody think of the children?" for each of its campaigns, and sometimes it fucking works, because she's a lunatic!

I obviously agree that payment processors (and well, game storefronts) should ban games that promote incest, rape, stuff like that, there's a lot of useless garbage on Steam that thankfully was now delisted, but this opens the gates to digital fascist thinking, thought crime and whatnot! Today it's "*won't somebody think of the children? somebody needs to protect them from games that encourage rape and child violence!*", but because Melinda is a fucking TERF, in a week this *will* actually become "*won't somebody think of the children? somebody needs to protect them from games that promote diversity, inclusion, LGBTQ+ content, it's harmful!*"

In 2014, the org protested Grand Theft Auto V, describing it as a "video game that encourages players to brutally murder women for entertainment", which is wholly and completely fucking false! GTA games allow you to kill any NPC in equal ways, it's not restricted to women. And none of the violence in Grand Theft Auto can ever be claimed to be brutal, there is no gore in this game, and blood is very sparse, overall any bloody impacts or wounds are clean. If you want to call something brutal, only games like DOOM and ULTRAKILL can fall under that category, you bumbling buffoons!

In 2018, she promoted a petition to ban the sale of Detroit: Become Human in Australia because she said the game contained themes of "child abuse and violence against women". She didn't even play the fucking game! She didn't even watch a full walkthrough of the game's story to find out that the game contains these themes, because the game does not encourage this stuff, it shines light on it, the atrocity, the victims of this stuff! **How DARE you try to ban a video game without first playing through the entire game to get a glimpse of the entire context around it? You should be deeply ashamed for this, Melinda!**

Vice's operator Savage Ventures pulled down two articles written by reporter Ana Valens describing the situation around Detroit: become Human, and the association of the group with retweeting a TERF claiming that "pervert nerds are responsible for most of society's ills" (*off-topic tangent, but this is similar to what the Soviet Union and Fidel Castro's stance was against homosexuals and the greater LGBTQ+ community*), and expressed doubts about the game promoting or depicting child abuse, because the game's actions area meant to encourage concern and care in the player - you know, fucking *empathy*, something this woman pretty much lacks.

**All I can say to Melinda is:** *Go fuck yourself, you Christian fascist. Jesus would fucking weep if he wasn't an imaginary moral tale. You're just a piece of shit, stop hiding behind the "won't somebody think of the children?" stance and just come out already as someone that doesn't give a fuck, and just wants to control what people can do.*

**And to the payment processors:** *Walk back your support for Collective Shout and Melinda. PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, Paysafe Limited, Discover, JCB CEOs (*all 6 CEOs are men, by the way*), decry Collective Shout's open letter. Why would you support someone's veiled Christofascism and thought crime, literal censorship of game and articles, under the guise of protecting your children? Why would you support such a piece of shit person and her organisation? You can demonstrate proper corporate social responsibility and immediately cease supporting Collective Shout.*

**Don't send Melinda threats, don't send her rape or NSFW content. Raise awareness of this issue, raise awareness of who Melinda is, what she and her organisation, Collective Shout, actually stand for.**

## Gambling bans? More like per-city bans

The guvment is proposing the [decentralisation of gambling decision-making](https://jurnaluldearges.ro/fiecare-primarie-va-decide-daca-vrea-sau-nu-pacanele-in-localitatea-sa-397218/), so that each local authority (e.g. the city mayor) can decide if they want to authorize or not the gambling activity in the locality they manage. As if city mayors are totally incorruptible or something!

Meanwhile, a former economic (finance? so CFO?) director at a state-run company has been [arrested and accused of stealing **over 900,000 EUR**](https://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/actualitate/o-directoare-a-fost-acuzata-ca-a-delapidat-900-000-de-euro-a-recunoscut-ca-a-pierdut-banii-la-pariuri-sportive.html) from the amounts she was managing for the company, and that she had spent all the money on online sports betting (gambling).

The prosecutors of the Bucharest Prosecution Office claim that the economic director had unlimited access to the financial funds of the state company and would have made in just three and a half months no less than 18 transfers to the company owned by her husband. And it would have caused a prejudice (damage) of over 900,000 euros. The alleged fraud had been revealed after an internal control, after the woman had resigned.

If she's found guilty - for which, according to her attorney, she completely assumes her responsibility for the committed crime -, she could face up to 10 years.

But no guys, the *cities* themselves should decide if they want to keep betting and gambling...

As for statistics: >15% of adults (over 18) are engaged in some form of gambling or betting. The incidence of gambling addiction in people over 18 is 0.6%, ~98,000 people. The most hardcore of gamblers are usually young men (aged 18-24), unmarried, from an urban setting, with a medium level of education.

In the whole country, there are over 10,000 betting agencies, and over 70,000 machines where you can bet - they're named in Romanian 'păcănele', basically slot machines you'd see in casinos in Las Vegas, for example. But these can be found pretty much everywhere, in villages and cities alike. We're placed higher than the UK when it comes to the average number of slot machines per 10,000 population. According to a [betting site's statistics](https://cazino365.ro/blog/jocurile-de-noroc-din-romania-in-cifre/) using numbers from the National Office for Betting Games (ONJN in Romanian), the average is as follows:

| Country   | Total slot machines num | Average slot machine num per 10,000 pop |
| --------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Romania   | 89,913                  | 4.7 |
| UK        | 151,260                 | 2.2 |
| Australia | 190,349                 | 7.3 |
| Italy     | 380,000                 | 6.4 |

As one might expect, the betting lobby in Romania is just as powerful as in other countries. Popular right-wing news site and television RomaniaTV is among the paid press (which is already paid by Russia, and has violated numerous times throughout the years laws and rules from the National Audiovisual Council (CNA in Romanian)) which is paid to encourage betting and favour betting news such as [licking Superbet's ass](https://www.romaniatv.net/soc-superbet-opreste-sponsorizarile-in-romania-din-cauza-noilor-majorari-de-taxe_9018634.html) for donating to 'good causes' like sponsoring sports teams and funding hospitals.

**It is unbelievably bone-headed and r-ed to be living in a day and age where a fucking BETTING operator is funding the construction and modernisation of hospitals in Romania, because the government is utterly fucking inept!** The Superbet Group / Superbet Foundation has equipped 67 hospitals country-wide with 110 [oxygen concentrators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_concentrator) and 3000 masks for these devices!

## Exorcisms in 2025

European country, everybody. NATO member, everyone! [A girl in Dumbrăveni, a city in the Sibiu municipality, was finally picked up by child protection services after being subjected to a so-called exorcism ritual by her mother](https://www.g4media.ro/o-fata-din-sibiu-care-a-fost-supusa-unui-ritual-de-exorcizare-de-catre-mama-sa-a-fost-preluata-de-protectia-copilului.html). According to a description of the video, the girl is crying while the woman is speaking prayers, holding a bible in her hand. The police has opened a criminal case of bad treatments applied to the minor girl.

At least we don't have yet another [rain ritual](https://techhub.social/@alextecplayz/112841470066786503) to grow our crops in times of drought. Wait, [nevermind](https://www.g4media.ro/patriarhia-romana-indeamna-la-rugaciune-pentru-stingerea-incendiilor-de-vegetatie-in-timpul-sfintei-liturghii-vor-fi-incluse-cererile-speciale-la-vreme-de-orice-nevoie-si-primejdie-omeneasca.html), there was a ritual in March, praying to God to stop the vegetation fires.

*More slop to come soon! I will probably publish another post by Saturday or Sunday, if things evolve.*
