*This June's A22 5G is looking impressive on paper, but the software just isn't there. I bought this phone a week ago, it's better in some cases, but sometimes worse than my A10.*

## Pros and Cons

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
| -------- | -------- |
| Better performance, runs most of the latest titles at a good framerate | Impressive on-paper camera specs, in practice it can fail, a lot. |
| Impressive 5,000 mAh battery | NFC is region-dependent |
| 90Hz 6.6" 1080p FHD+ display | A22 4G (LTE) is superior in some ways, and at least $50 cheaper |
| Android 11, One UI Core 3.1 | One UI Core instead of One UI, even if the phone is more than capable |
| 5G at an affordable price | - |

## Cameras
Cameras are likely a big talking point of most Samsung phones, and while this phone's cameras are acceptable, they fall very short compared to most phones at the same price range.

The Galaxy A22 5G features three rear and one front camera, only one of those can take photos comparable to the Galaxy A10 which I have been using for around a year and a half.

The only camera that can hold a candle to the Galaxy A10 in most cases is the 48MP wide camera. I'm not kidding when I say that the other cameras are a joke. While using the 48MP camera I could not zoom in/out from the Camera app, so that could be an issue for some.

There is no Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) on any cameras on the 5G variant unfortunately, which is quite disappointing. I know Samsung wants to cut corners and make good phones as cheap as they can, but i feel like they could have kept OIS among other features.

The wide camera's photos immediately show that it is weak, and perhaps should have been improved instead of getting downgraded from 8MP to 5MP. Same goes for the nonexistent 2MP macro camera from the 4G variant.

The video resolution is pretty uncommon, 1152P@30Fps, something I've rarely, if ever, encountered before.

It has a Night Mode which is more like Night Vision to me sometimes, a basic Pro mode, Panorama and a Snapchat ripoff mode with animated and static cat and dog ears.

*While Casi may like the photo showing how handsome it is, I'm not very pleased with the cameras.*

Front camera? Same story here, A22 4G is better here as well, even though both look pretty similar and pretty low-res but good enough for video calls.

## Design
It is one of the more unique designs from the Galaxy A series, along with its 4G counterpart, and the Galaxy A72, A32, A32s, A52 phones, and the newly released A12. It is more common in the Galaxy M series, most notably the Galaxy M22 and the M32.

*The back of the phone, the matte plastic looks very nice, although will slip on a wood surface without a case.*

## Battery
5,000mAh is very respectable in this price range, and well reasoned, considering it has a 90Hz capable display. In my testing, watching YouTube videos at 60Hz, playing Call of Duty Mobile at Medium, 90Hz and a few more games at 90Hz and 60Hz respectively, using Twitter, Instagram and reddit at 90Hz and the casual note taking, it lasted me about a day on a single charge to 100%.

Battery overheating: The battery will heat up to a bit over my comfortable temperature and may get hot, this is likely to happen when using the 15W Fast Charge, which can be disabled from Battery and device care > Battery > More battery settings

## Performance
Respectable performance, has decent AR, smooth 90Hz display and very rarely hiccups or lag, heats up during a longer session, but no more than a conformable temperature.

## Variant comparison
See the differences between the variants below.

| **Device / Spec** | **Galaxy A22 4G** | **Galaxy A22 5G** |
| **Price** | EUR 200 | EUR 250 |
| **RAM Memory** | 4/6GB | 4/6/8GB |
| **Storage** | 64/128GB | 64/128GB |
| **Rear cameras** | Quad camera setup: 48MP OIS Main / 8MP Ultrawide / 2MP Macro / 2MP Depth sensing camera | Triple camera setup: 48MP Main / 5MP Ultrawide / 2MP Depth sensing camera |
| **Front camera** | 13MP | 8MP |
| **Display** | 6.4" Super AMOLED, 90Hz, 720x1600px | 6.6" TFT, 90Hz, 1080x2400px |
| **HDR** | Available | No |
| **NFC** | No | Yes (region-dependent) |
| **Chipset (System-on-Chip)** | Mediatek Helio G80, 12nm | Mediatek MT6833 Dimensity 700 5G, 5nm |
| **Weight** | 168g | 203g |
| **Main camera max video resolution** | 1080P@30FPS | 1152P@30FPS |
| **System** | Android 11 (OneUI Core 3.1) | Android 11 (OneUI Core 3.1) |

## Conclusion
In my opinion, the phone looks nice, the photos are decent but sometimes worse than my cheaper A10 phone, the performance and battery are good, but I wish Samsung kept the better components from the 4G counterpart.
