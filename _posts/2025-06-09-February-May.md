Hello! Things have happened in these past few months - bad and good! Sorry for my absence on the blog, although this is probably somehing you're used to - if I have ANY readers, and not just rambling alone here. Either way, here's a, to-the-best-of-my-abilities recap since February.

#### February

- Started work on Feb 3, had to stay at home the week between 18-23 Feb because of gastroenteritidis.
- One of my best friends / sort-of-perhaps-crush(*?*) also <allegedly> unknowingly got a job as a courier at the same company as I was working at. Things were quite great until late April, but we'll get there.
- Discovered that not only do I hate myself the most, but also have a very low opinion of myself, and blame myself and over-stress for even the tiniest mistakes at work.
- Having a 2 hour commute (1h to work, 1h back home) and 9-10 hours of work with crappy pay tires you a lot, despite just sitting in a chair in an office all day and working on a computer. I'd regularly feel very tired and unable to do stuff after work, having to resort to just watching a movie, playing a game or watching an episode or two of a show in the 4 hours of freetime I'd have every night, before going to sleep. This is what ultimately made me decide to use Godot as a base for Sapphire instead of developing it from the ground-up.
- Despite all of this, I'd start to spend more free-time with my (now-courier/coworker) best friend, and he'd start to teach me how to drive, by the end of the month. I enjoyed these moments a lot.

#### March

March is more of the same. Pretty much just...work, with very little free-time, and even fewer time to meet with friends. Still, continued to learn to drive, aided by my friend. Ended up tracking something I've noticed for quite a while now - a week of stomach problems between 8 and 15 every month - something that I plan to investigate eventually, I think it could be a hormonal imbalance or something? I do have mood swings in that week as well.

#### April

April is a month of confidence for me. By now, my coworkers knew that I was Bi and Trans, everyone thankfully was - and still is - supportive of this. By far, the people and the culture at this company, are fantastic. This month, I finally booked an appointment with a psychiatrist - which asked me some basic questions (e.g. how long you've known you were Trans, how did you discover this, have you told anyone, how did people react to finding out you're trans, what do you expect to get from this), and ultimately recommended me a psychological report and couldn't give me the Gender Dysphoria diagnostic because I wasn't 20 at the time - so it was written only as an observation. Also had a psychiatrist appointment, really chill person that seemed to be understanding, professional and helpful. The report didn't reveal anything shocking about me - possible signs of SzPD (which is most likely full-on SzPD, it's just that I was under the baseline because 1 hour may not be enough to tell that I'm SzPD due to my 'social masks' and now my experience talking to clients and more people), and under-baseline borderline.

But April is a month of disappointment, to some extent. I finally confessed to my best friend / sort-of-perhaps-crush that I might like him, or that it's simply the dynamic between the two of us - where I'm much happier when he's around, I smile constantly, I'm praticall glowing, and he makes me feel like a woman the most - and he told me he needed to think. A couple of days later, he pretty much broke everything up with me, and stopped talking to me after calling me on a saturday noon and listing off 11 reasons as to why we can't be together. He's done this whole 'Don't speak to me again' thing back in late December just before Christmas as well, motivated by, at the time, Calin Georgescu and all of the right-wing garbage happening at the time, post-presidential election cancellation.

He's a nice person and all, he genuinely means well, but his right-wing Orthodox upbringing, with a father that told him 'Don't bring any girl around' (not in the sense that he's fine with gay relationships, but as in, 'Don't bring anyone around'), his deeper sinking in the right-wing alpha male Griftiverse, worshipping Andrew Tate constantly, siding with Putin, Trump and the Romanian legionnaires (Romanian brand of fascism that mixes in Orthodox Christianity with anti-semitism) made him take some hard, sharp turns and choices such as breaking up with me, when he's OBVIOUSLY into me as well - at least, he appears to be interested in me, from my and my other two best friends' points of view. THIS is what 'Alpha Males' and fascists cause. Real damage to well-meaning people that are too gullible to fall in their traps and scams.

I realize that talking about all of this exposes some of vulnerabilities to the world, but it's not like this blog is read by more than a couple people in its lifetime, TBH. If more people DO read it though, that's cool as well. You're reading about a side of me that I may not always show on Fedi, or to others. I'd say blogging is therapeutic, more people should write their thoughts online (*as long as they're not thoughts spreading harmful or dangerous ideologies or opinions, hate etc.*)

#### May

Okay, May was just a fever dream IMO. Here's where the [NSFW WARNING] is useful, because I generally don't talk about this, just because it didn't seem like something I'd write on this blog.

By the end of April, my department coworkers would find out that yes, me being bi and trans, I have some...*needs* and *fantasies*, such as having a dildo that I use regularly (*tips on anal play blog post wen?? jkjk unless...*). Well, I bought another one. It seemingly couldn't fit in the locker so I had to order it to an address. And I couldn't just let the courier deliver it home, because I still live with my parents, and not only is it not their problem, but they still don't know that I'm Bi and Trans, so the next best option was have it delivered to...my workplace.

I bought [this](https://www.emag.ro/dildo-din-silicon-charybdis-epic-300mm-lungime-40mm-diametru-multicolor-forma-tentacul-fetishd-239480/pd/DYD7ZCYBM), a 31.5cm tentacle dildo that I oh so love compared to the first [dildo I ever bought](https://www.emag.ro/dildo-pink-17-5-cm-chisa00205/pd/DY20RCYBM/), it arrived from Spain via DHL *fucking* Express 1 day after I placed the order. Now, this is where things get murky. The brand on eMAG is Leilao, but DHL and the package mentions a different company altogether, related to PCs or something like that, considering the name is 'PC LOGISTIC', not Leilao, on the DHL site. Right around this time, a 32GB RAM order on eMAG gets cancelled a day earlier by the seller because they ran out of stock, so I order some to pick up at a specialized PC part store instead.

Seeing this message, I thought that perhaps the eMAG seller cancelled my RAM order by mistake and is sending me the RAM to my workplace address based on my latest order's choice of address or something. So when the day arrives and I walk back into the office with a 30CM tall brown envelope, it's probably no surprise as to what was actually in the package.

I open this package at work, under the eyes of my coworkers, which are all very interested to see my new toy, considering they're not brave enough to even try anal play, moreso to order a 30cm long tentacle dildo. A couple of laughs later, word begins to spread.

Now, I kid you not. If this was a company where fun was against the rules and the 'corporate' environment would be as sterile as a virus lab, this would probably land me in HR's office warning me to 'not do it again' or something. But everyone, and I mean everyone, is really chill and cool with so much stuff, it's unbelievable. It's why I call this month a fever dream.

One of my coworkers has been secretly dating a team leader for nearly a month at that point, so of course, he comes around to see my toy around. Other team leaders, one by one, come as well. It's all good! Laughs, jokes, hilarious situation, yadda yadda. But I kid you not, even the franchisor himself, the big boss, the director of this franchised company, comes around to see the 'big problem' in the office. And there it is, in all of its glory. Still packaged but flexible, stands tall my new tentacle on my desk.

Anyway yeah, everybody has a great time, I (obviously) try out my new purchase at home (and I'm *very* satisfied with it), but things turn somewhat sour.

May 26, we hear rumours of a meeting both departments (Dispatch and Customer Service) will have at 2PM. My coworkers get called one-by-one slowly to be informed that they're being let go, because there's a restructuring of both departments. And it's true, they merged both departments, now there are only three people in total (2 at dispatch, 1 at customer service). IMO, a useless restructuring, because things weren't dire with our departments in any way. Still, there has been some resentment for both of the former 'leaders' of both departments, and their attitudes, so it was expected that they'd just quit on the spot and leave.

I get transferred over to the 'Front' (reception / front office), starting May 27. I mean, I like it. It's not very different from what I did at Dispatch, creating expeditions for clients, checking AWBs for statuses, giving people their packages from the reception warehouse or the main warehouse, cashing in their payments for sending or receiving expeditions via cash or card, restitutions and repayments (cash on delivery that gets sent back to the sender via envelope or bank account).

#### June

But it's on the same salary as before, Saturday work is compensated with 1%, and now I work ~8 hours (currently, I've worked the first week (May 27-30) in the morning from 9AM to 5PM, with Saturday from 9AM to noon at the reception of a different office that was the last to close in a long line of courier locations - leaving only the HQ in the city being the only standing HQ - and then worked in the afternoon shift which seems to be more appropriate for me since I'd have the morning to myself before going to work for a shift between 11AM and 7:20PM), but I still feel tired. And this being the summer, and having a somewhat broken AC in the reception, I'd be sweaty, feeling hot and uncomfortable all the time, not just tired.

And despite the great times I've had there, I feel like there's no future for me there. No growth in salary, unless I'd be willing to spend another half year or so to get a measly $25 extra or whatever.

I don't *hate* or *resent* the work I do. I think it's really neat and cool, interacting with all kinds of clients - both regular clients and new ones - every day. But this work involves walking about between the main warehouse, a secondary, smaller building with two compartiments for the volume packages and packages that belonged to other locations/courier offices in the city, and the reception, all on >30C heat because it's all pratically asphalt with zero shade, and I'm barely fit to lift >15kg since I haven't worked out since last summer - a summer that felt deeply miserable due to the scorching heat that will undoubtedly get worse this year, and the next, and so on.

And at the same time, I realize that I'm privileged to even be in this position to begin with, but I need to have standards for myself, because otherwise I'd end up just doing work that may be fulfilling to some degree, but chronically tiring and financially unsustainable, as I plan to leave the country someday, build my own house, buy some rather expensive tech and a car, and just live my life, plus not having much of a freetime - or whatever free time I do have, I end up doing fuck all because I'm dead tired. Above all though, the privilege to be openly (yet not so visibly, since there are no visible changes yet) Bi and Trans in Romania, all thanks to the welcoming, funny and helpful people at a courier company that people review pretty poorly on Google Maps because people are stupid and have some abnormally high expectations at times. Crazy stuff.

<hr>

With that said, I suppose I'm looking for work. Again. The plan is to apply to some jobs starting June 10, including part-time fully remote work such as Customer Service, Dispatch, Helpdesk, and so on. If you have at all any suggestions, or perhaps know of openings in such roles (or even in web design, but only with HTML and CSS, not some framework like Angular or React - a rare job position, if it still exists), don't hesitate to @ me on Fedi.

<br>

Thank you for reading all of this stuff. Really. It might read as a rant at times, but it's not. It's just my unfiltered mind on a hot midnight in June, wondering what the hell are my plans for the future...

<br>

**JUNE 12 EDIT:** I told HR on Tuesday (June 10) that I'm searching for fully remote work in IT and that I can't stay in the reception department anymore. Today, the right hand of the franchisor reached out to me after hearing that I might be quitting, and offered me my old position (at the Dispatch department), with a large salary increase (currently earning 2800 RON / €558 / $640 net pay) to a whopping 5000 RON (€995 / $1151), and that I'd start Monday. That is most definitely an offer I can't refuse. I'll see if this salary increase turns out to be true, and will update this post (and my CV) accordingly.
