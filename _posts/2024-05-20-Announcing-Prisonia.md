It's time for a game announcement, no? Introducing **Prisonia**, a top-down 2D prison management game that blends mechanics from games such as Prison Architect and The Escapists 2, and builds upon them with additional features, and much more in the future.

## The Why?

The game has been in on/off development since as early as January 2024, when it was merely an idea stemmed from a mod I was creating for Prison Architect, that wanted to expand upon the base game's features with much more content and features. However, Prison Architect is somewhat limited when it comes to modding. By December 2023, I knew that I wanted to transform it into a game, instead. And don't you love getting pick-pocketed every once in a while for new content that might as well have been part of the base game, but they're sold as DLC instead?

## Early Access

Prisonia will launch in Early Access later in 2024. Bi-weekly or monthly updates during Early Access, where I deliver content related to one theme at a time. (Themes include locations, mechanics, seasons, events, etc.)

What do I want to achieve? Better mod support in Unreal Engine using the *LuaMachine* plugin, that allows me to export Blueprint functions as Lua code which can then be accessed by modders, not just on PC, but later, on mobile. Because yes, Prisonia will also launch on Android, at a later date, however I'm excited to say that mods do work from my testing.

## How much?

$25.00, no DLC, no extra editions or additional paid content, DRM-free. Coming to Steam and Itch. Maybe other storefronts later on as well.
