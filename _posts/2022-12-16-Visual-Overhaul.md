*After delays and multiple design prototypes & phases, it's finally here. The new redesign of my website, alongside a domain change from alexhowell2a to alextecplayz.*

## Why would you redesign the website?

I always had the idea to create my own design system, and apply it to stuff like websites, and seeing how I wasn't really pleased with the Minimal Mistakes template, I decided that it was the perfect opportunity to finally achieve this idea.

I juggled with lots of ideas, from modern to retro, Linux terminal-like designs, brutalism and minimalism, but I always felt that it wasn't really what I wanted. That's how I (sorta) came up with this design system, that I call Obsidian.

Do keep in mind, that even if the website 'design' is complete, that doesn't mean I won't stop improving upon this design, polishing up stuff like font pairings, colors, and also change it up using accent colours, depending on the season, or event.

This is the current accent colour.

The website will always be in development in my mind, and I will try to be more active, when I have time. Currently, I'm busy with Project Mountain, and some other things, but rest assured I will continue to keep you peeps posted if anything interesting happens.

## What are your future plans?

Moving forward, I will use the GitHub repo Issues and Projects categories to set up To-Do lists and roadmaps for the website, for example 'Article about the use of matrices in games and Unreal 5, estimated to release December 16', which, at the time of writing this, is already up on the site, ready to read.

The old website has been archived, as I will still use it to link old media from, like thumbnails or CSS.

Here's some of the new elements that I've used. This is a code block:

{% highlight cpp %}
[x y z 1]
{% endhighlight %}

I'm also working on a media player that goes well with the new website, along other things. Stay tuned for more, soon!

## Any updates on project X or Y? Anything new?

Project Hangar isn't cancelled, but it's on hold. I expect to work on it again after I wrap up with Project Mountain.

Speaking of, Project Mountain is still going well, still at the primary features development phase, with some concept art and lore being made as well.

Project 'Eiffel' is still viable. Project Odyssey is in early concept phase, with lots of concept art made already, but I don't expect to start development any time soon.

Vanta Interactive's website will get a visual overhaul this year.

Projects BARBET and MOREL are still underway, no new updates yet.
