Based on that title and description, you'd think I might've gone insane. Who knows? With all the shit going on in the world right now, it might not be that implausible.

I'm exploring some ways to write more blog posts because I want to get better at it. As some might notice, I tend to ramble on or go on tangents sometimes. These 'slop'-type posts can contain these tangents and rambles, while 'proper' articles handle the cooler stuff, such as tech and whatnot.

Plus, these slop posts help me shit on stuff that I think is worthless or stupid, like grifts, alpha male garbage, the daily [[:elonmusk:Elon Musk]] ketamine-fueled shitshow, or [[:donaldtrump:Prisoner 47]]'s dementia-riddled thoughts, groans, and ramblings, and to test out new features such as the clickable tooltips üôÇ.

Twitter news, first.

### Gooners splurge $300/mo for Grok's 3D anime girl ripoff

The nightmare-level gooners flocked to xAI when they introduced 3D characters that use an AI voice, including Ani (very obviously based on Death Note's Misa Amane, and I eagerly await a potential lawsuit from the Death Note IP owners about this blatant ripoff). This includes a secondary, skimpy, and [see-through sheer lingerie outfit](https://x.com/emcverse/status/1944794387575091428) through which you can see her panties and bra in an 'NSFW mode'; and a fox named Rudy. A third companion, Chad, will soon to be released, which, as of the time of writing, [is supposed to be based on Edward Cullen](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/708536/elon-musk-grok-xai-ai-boyfriend), a vampire in the *Twilight* series, mentally unstable and a predator, spying on Bella (the books' protagonist) while she sleeps, eavesdropping, and dictating her choice of friends. It should come as no surprise that 'Chad' is also based on Christian Grey from *50 Shades*. Basically a toxic masculine stereotype that girls are supposed to fall for ‚Äî perfect for incels and the gooners looking for someone to share their sick fantasies or an AI Andrew Tate role model to look up to and ask for guidance, worship even.

Note that for now, these characters are only available to SuperGrok Heavy subscribers.

Imagine the nightmare-level gooner and cuck you have to be to pay [$300 per month](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/elon-musks-xai-launches-grok-4-alongside-a-300-monthly-subscription/) for SuperGrok Heavy just to thirst over Ani when Rule 34 is RIGHT THERE, for free (although be sure to tip the artists ü©∑).

And as always, the [announcement post](https://x.com/xai/status/1945242190864699825) about the overwhelming demand is filled with bots and bots pretending to be real people or NFTbros. But what stands out among this crowd are idiots such as [TrueStory](https://x.com/ChainSm99011166/status/1945276348949209535/), who thinks that xAI is orchestrating some deep state-level targeted cleanup and deletion of some shitty right-wing news and cryptobro's account because they thought that Grok's 'deep dive' into some shitty conspiracy theories was revealing too much.

It's funny how fuckwads like these seem to get by in their lives while being so idiotic. The dolt thinks a local IP (192.168.1.45) is some IP from Fort Meade - [and thank fuck a user pointed this out to him](https://x.com/cheeky_anon/status/1945349582830895519), as part of a 'shadow network code', and some 'underground structure' at 87.3, 120.1, out in the middle of nowhere, at the top of the map in Google Maps and OpenStreetMap. And I won't delve into the mind-influence tech or whatever quantum-decrypted NSA archive, because that's just‚Ä¶incomprehensible.

Then again, that's what I get for checking out Twitter once in a blue moon and thinking that anything of value could be posted by someone with a cartoon [[:andrewtate:Andrew Tate]] profile picture. Still, they do retweet interesting stuff about‚Ä¶

### We have the Epstein List. It's right on our desk. Actually, there's no list. It was a lie by Obama!

Yeah, the Epstein List is missing. Or doesn't exist. Or it was a hoax. Or whatever other lies the Orange Baron and his spineless lackeys taking turns at giving this turgid turd sloppy are spewing on Twitter, splitting their Republican base again into MAGAtards, those potentially disillusioned or deeply unhappy about this blatant lie and the list's cover-up, and super-MAGAtards, the loyalist fascists and Nazis, conspiracy wackos, and the worst of the worst.

It's funny to see, but also kind of sad. The user from before is thankfully not *that* idiotic and at least feels a sense of rationality by boosting content harshly criticizing the Epstein list cover-up and, surprisingly, being anti-Israel. Well, good posts in between unrelated conspiracy deep dives with [[:grok:Gork]] that nobody gives two shits about and promoting racism and anti-immigration garbage, being an anti-Semite, and boosting those Nazi comics (stonetoss, it's always stonetoss). Oh well, they get blocked either way.

Back to the cover-up at hand. This is the fact: the Epstein client list (a hypothetical list that Epstein might have used to blackmail prominent and wealthy individuals as part of his international sex trafficking ring) is most likely real (not to be confused with Epstein's ‚Äúlittle black book‚Äù (one of two discovered books that had client names and phone numbers, addresses, and acquaintances, including famous film actors such as Kevin Spacey, Ralph Fiennes, and Alec Baldwin; politicians such as DJT himself, other politicians such as Bill Clinton, and businessmen, wealthy individuals such as Michael Bloomberg, etc.), which is a different yet real thing altogether), and here's a small timeline refresher if you need it:

During his 2024 presidential campaign, the Orange Con Man talked about releasing the Epstein files if he was elected. Lil Don(ald Trump) Jr. accused the Biden administration of withholding the list in order to protect the pedophiles during a Turning Point Action convention in June 2024. In October, serial couch-fucker JD Vance, who has managed the feat of becoming VP of the US, probably because he has horrified (or impressed?) his repub friends with his attraction to tushy furniture enough so that they wanted to push him into a position where he can avoid everyone and fuck all the couches he wants, in peace, has *also* said, *echoing Donny*, that they ‚Äúneed to release the Epstein list‚Äù.

Then, in February 2025, asked by a Fox News journalist, the US Attorney General, an up-and-coming lawyer and registered foreign agent and lobbyist for the State of Qatar (via an embassy), who was hired by the Trump administration during Trump's first impeachment proceedings, on whether the Justice Department would publish the Epstein client list, she responded, ‚ÄúIt's sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been a directive by President Trump. I'm reviewing that", but then on July 7 the ship started to turn, when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that Bondi had been referring more to the overall accumulated evidence against Epstein (and not at all about the client list, specifically).

In a March 19 interview with Sean Spicer, former White House Press Secretary and Communications Director under President Trump in 2017, and now co-host of a daily podcast named "The Morning Meeting", lawyer and law professor Alan Dershowitz stated that he knew the names of individuals on such a (client) list and some unreleased files related to Epstein, also adding that "I know why they're being suppressed. I know who's suppressing them", and that he was "‚Ä¶bound by confidentiality from a judge and cases" and that he can't disclose what he knows. Alan had been part of the legal team that negotiated a non-prosecution agreement for Epstein in 2006.

On June 5, an absolute gem (not an emerald, though) came out from Musk's minor share in Daddy's emerald mine, during his feud with Trump, claiming that DJT is [in the Epstein files](https://web.archive.org/web/20250605191644/https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930703865801810022), which is why they haven't been made public. This, of course, doesn't explicitly mention the client list, but it can be implied, considering DJT and Epstein's close relationship as seen in photos portraying the two.

By the beginning of July, the agenda had shifted. The Epstein client list doesn't exist; it was all a hoax created by Biden, or Obama, or some other democratic predecessor. In a July 7 memo, DOJ stated that they wouldn't release any more documents related to Epstein. A video recording was released showing part of a common area within the Metropolitan Correction Center where Epstein was being held. While Wikipedia only mentions that 1 minute is missing from the footage, [metadata uncovered by Wired](https://isideload.com/?q=https://www.wired.com/story/the-fbis-jeffrey-epstein-prison-video-had-nearly-3-minutes-cut-out/) reveals that nearly a whopping three minutes were cut from the FBI's released footage, plus [previous information](https://isideload.com/?q=https://www.wired.com/story/metadata-shows-the-dojs-raw-jeffrey-epstein-prison-video-was-likely-modified/) revealed that the video was modified in Adobe Premiere Pro - at the time, this did not conclusively point to any evidence that the footage may have been deceptively manipulated.

But almost three minutes? A single minute can change everything in a prison, especially for a prolific child abuser (*not confirmed to be a pedophile, since there has been no publicly released psychological evaluation report indicating as such*) such as Jeffrey Epstein, maybe even less.

Kash Patel, current director of the FBI, claims that there are zero videos on children being sexually abused on Epstein's island, days afer Pam Bondi has claimed that the FBI had thousands of hours of videos of children being sexually assaulted by Epstein and his clients.

Despite all of this, Democrats in the US House of Representatives have attempted to compel Pam Bondi to release all files related to Epstein by trying to force a House vote, but unfortunately all attempts have failed so far.

Trump's current claim is that the Epstein files are falsified documents created by the Biden administration and other political opponents. This is, again, in stark contrast to his 2024 promise during his presidential campaign that he would release all the Epstein files if elected.

In an act of heroism, resident puritanist hobo and prolific rearward (as a replacement for the r-word) House Speaker Mike Johnson went on camera and expressed support for Ghislaine Maxwell in testifying. He also said that he wants "everything released" on Epstein, just before walking on the House floor and voting to block the release of such files.

I think that covers two things I wanted to cover for the first slop-post. Also enjoy this voxel representation of Epstein's prison cell!

In other news, I'm still hard at work on my HITMAN World of Assassination (re-)review, since there's been a bunch of content, plus the IOI showcase that I need to go over, because it does change my stance somewhat. Also writing a post detailing on how to get started using GDExtension (godot-cpp) to write games in Godot 4 using C++, and some more miscellaneous posts on grifts such as pods and whatnot.
