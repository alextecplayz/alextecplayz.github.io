## Studio history

Yes, you've heard that right. Vanta Interactive turns six this month. Here's a short history: the studio initially started out as an idea in April 2018, as a future idea between two school colleagues, of a no-nonsense, no greed, game studio that would create cool games without falling prey to all the bad shit in the industry.

In the summer of 2019, I branded it as '2A Games' (2 friends with the initial 'A', making games), and released JumpGame, a quick prototype I made in 3 days to showcase what skills I have quickly learned over the past month or so, where you would jump around multiple maps, because why not. It was always intended as a joke, but even back then, I wanted to give comprehensive settings toggles to players, so they can tweak their performance to their liking.

Sometime later, I started publishing some silly devlogs of '*GRAV0RTAL*', a project that was supposed to create, in Unreal Engine 4, my fictional take on Half-Life 2: Episode Three and a sequel to Portal 3, as I was inspired after seeing videos from Project Borealis, that was also using Unreal to create a game based on 'Epistle Three', written by Mark Laidlaw, and Thinking With Time Machine, a small Portal 2 mod on Steam that continued directly from Portal 2's ending cutscene.

I rebranded at some point to Evo-Catalyst Softworks, because I thought '2A Games' sounded boring, and could be confused with '4A Games', the developer studio behind the highly successful Metro series. But, I finally decided to land on 'Vanta Interactive', stemmed from my love of the 'vantablack' color, and just the word 'Vanta' in general. *Fun fact: vanta(black) comes from [Vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertically_aligned_carbon_nanotube_arrays), or vantas, a material on which [vantablack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vantablack), the darkest black surface coating known, is based on.*

And because I'm releasing a new game soon (*finally, a PROPER game! And no, it's not GRAV0RTAL unfortunately. That project has morphed into something else, and is on the future roadmap, but I cannot provide any details about it at this time*), I decided to finally give the Vanta Interactive website a proper [redesign and coat of paint](https://vantainteractive.com/en/), based on the Obsidian Design System I developed initially for this website. I also created [Docs](https://docs.vantainteractive.com/en/), [Legal](https://legal.vantainteractive.com), [API](https://api.vantainteractive.com), [Store](https://store.vantainteractive.com) and [Status](https://status.vantainteractive.com) subdomains for the studio. All but the Store and API subdomains use the Obsidian Design System as well. Store uses Gumroad, and API is not currently used, but there are plans to use it in the future for various projects and tests.

The rest of this post is the (in)formal variant of the page regarding the [history of the *main* website from the Docs website](https://docs.vantainteractive.com/en/websites/main):

## Site history

Unfortunately, the website designs of the 2A Games (v1) and ECS (v2) websites are lost in time, we did manage to find some details about the third version, where we first started using the Vanta Interactive name.

### Version 3

The blog was hosted using Google's Blogger platform, and we were using a free theme from the now-defunct ThemesWear website.

We had a secondary website for one of our projects at the time, GRAV0RTAL, also hosted by Blogger.

![The home page of the GRAV0RTAL site, it has some of the posts from 2A Games and ECS.](https://i.ibb.co/f982Frk/VI-Site-Archive-GV2020.png "The home page of the GRAV0RTAL site, it has some of the posts from 2A Games and ECS.")

The blog uses the free 'Basil' theme from SoraTemplates, loaded the FontAwesome and LinearIcons CSS, Testimonial CSS from Flickity, Animate CSS, jQuery min, WowJS, SlickNav Responsive Mobile Menu, jquery-match-height, Flickity, Waypoints, jquery-counterup, jQuery One Page Nav Plugin and SmoothScroll.

### Version 4

In late 2020, I switched to using the 'Slides' theme from FreeHTML5 for the Vanta Interactive blogger website, pictured below:

![The home page of Vanta Interactive, carrying over the posts from 2A Games and ECS.](https://i.ibb.co/4JxmkZb/VI-Site-Archive-2021.png "The home page of Vanta Interactive, carrying over the posts from 2A Games and ECS.")

As was the trend back then, most of the header buttons used to link to sections of the home page. 'About' would lead to the About Us section. We had pages for /games and /software, but they were blank, and the idea was to update them, but that never happened, for whatever reason. The page contained an ungodly amount of third-party CSS and JS code, such as Bootstrap CSS, some obfuscated JS that even to this day I have no idea what it was for, and at the end we had Waypoint JS, Easing JS, Stellar JS and Magnific Popup JS.

For some reason, at the time I also opened KX Design Lab, it was supposed to be a subdivision of VI that would handle website designs (Figma and HTML, CSS, JS) and app designs in Figma. It was supposed to be another freelance way for the studio to earn some money while teasing our game progress and whatnot. I also linked some of the music I made using FL Studio Mobile from BandCamp, and music used for our games. We also wanted to offer other services such as photography, another way to earn money. None of this went further than a conceptual stage.

### Version 5

In **February 2021**, I started the Vanta-Interactive organization on GitHub, and created the first GitHub Pages-hosted version of the site, using a free bootstrap 4 theme from ColorLib, Mostudio. This, too, used Magnific Popup, FlatIcons, FontAwesome, jQuery min and new scripts: jQuery migrate, popper, bootstrap min, jquery easing, jquery waypoints, jquery stellar, scrollax min, owl carousel, jquery AnimateNumber and Google Maps' js API. No, this didn't cut it either. So I scrapped all that and made a very minimalist site with a white background, and used pictures as links. I had enough of Bootstrap and terrible free templates.

And while in **October 2021** I was working on [my personal website](https://web.archive.org/web/20211001172806/https://alexhowell2a.github.io/), the website was [rotting away](https://web.archive.org/web/20210317220123/https://vanta-interactive.github.io/) with little to no updates. Finally, on December 20, 2022, I deleted the whole website and left it as it is, until this day, with no updates. The intention was to quickly finish up the personal website, polish Obsidian, then use it to quickly bring the VI site up to snuff, but that never happened, as I was busy finishing high school.

### Version 6 (Present)

Funnily, or, surprisingly enough, **as of April 2024, Vanta Interactive is six years old**. It's crazy how time has passed, and how much the studio has evolved - even if we never released any game outside of a [silly little game I pieced together in three days](https://vantainteractive.com/en/games/JumpGame). 

**Sixth time's the charm!** I had experienced burnout in the summer of 2023, even the thought of opening an HTML file related to my project was seriously depressing. And now, it's March/April 2024. I've been working on a proper game that is scheduled to release at the end of April, I need the website up and running. I quickly gather everything, polish Obsidian and I pieced together what you see today, using Jekyll and Liquid. The idea, previously, was to write my own CMS - a bad idea, especially when I knew well Jekyll, tried Hugo and had used Blogger before, which was horrible. Do you want to know how long it took to put everything together, update and rebuild all of this? *Drum roll, please!*

**All of the Vanta Interactive websites and the AlexTECPlayz website, were rebuilt using Jekyll in under a week.** *\<facepalm>* This includes me bringing over all the past posts from Blogger. Additional tweaks, adding 88x31 banners to the ATP website's homepage, writing a few more posts and whatnot took another few days of total work time, on top of the time previously mentioned.

What am I using today? Simple HTML, Obsidian CSS with some customizations specific to each website's use case, and very little JS. All fonts, css and js are loaded from the repository, because I have principles now. I care about privacy and security. I don't want to collect cookies, or to bombard the users with cookie pop-ups. How the times have changed.

*Note the goof in the top left corner, where the icon is used: The screenshot was taken during Ace Visibility Day, so the logo was using the Ace flag variant - because yes, the Vanta Interactive logo has variants for the 'main' queer flags ^w^*

## Future

**What are the plans for the future?** More polish, and maybe some additions to the home page, as more projects get teased or released. And because of Obsidian and Jekyll, everything is so much easier and faster to develop and ship. Less time working on the website and procrastinating, and more time working on games! (*even though I like both web and software development, there needs to be a strong balance in order to keep my sanity and not fall back in the pit of depression and burnout*). Obsidian is thankfully extensible, and will get additional features in the future, to make everything cooler.

Additionally, I have already (re)written a sizeable chunk of the 0R8 Wiki using Obsidian, for the ATP website before 0R8 was cancelled / put on hold, but I still want to finish the wiki and publish it on the site. That might happen this summer, when I have the time to write new posts regarding game development (yes, posts, finally!) and capture videos and screenshots needed for the wiki. This would just further display the flexibility of Obsidian as well. Now, Obsidian isn't *quite* really ready to be used by others. The CSS is more or less done for Obsidian 1.0, but I want to use Web Components to quickly write some useful components that would make it even easier to use, then the VI Docs would gain a section for Obsidian, and docs on how to get started with it. ETA? Who knows.

There's a portfolio page in the works as well, because now that I am *sort of* freeing up time to make some more stuff, I want to create more website designs and showcase them on that page, besides game projects and software. No ETA, I would first need some designs and projects to showcase over there.
