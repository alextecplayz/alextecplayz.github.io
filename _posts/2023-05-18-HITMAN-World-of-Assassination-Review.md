## HITMAN World of Assassination, delisting of old games
The game is now the 'definitive' place to play all 3 HITMAN games from the World of Assassination trilogy, which is great, although I do not agree at all with their decision to unlist HITMAN and HITMAN 2. It's important to preserve those games, since they're awesome and have their own unique things.

## Freelancer
Now, Freelancer was added, alongside a few bug fixes and small quality of life improvements, but I'm still generally not excited about Freelancer. I don't like rogue-lite games or modes in general, but HITMAN Freelancer feels harder - although that might just be attributed to my lack of interest in rogue-lites. I love the new safehouse and the unlockable content, the trophy case system is great (You get trophies when you complete certain challenges like kill X amount of targets, kill X amount of Syndicate leaders, etc.)

## Freelancer improvements
Freelancer has so much more potential though, and after 40 hours of just playing Freelancer, I'm horribly burnt out, not just on Freelancer, but HITMAN as a whole. I haven't gotten most of the trophies, and I'm fine with that. I might be a completionist, but I'm not that stupid to keep playing the same boring stuff over and over, hoping I wouldn't fall asleep or get fatigued with it. The maps aren't really changed compared to the normal 'main' missions. There's so many ideas to improve this though: random times of days for ALL Freelancer maps, which could introduce some more variety to the map 'roster', alongside random scenarios from all the map's missions & escalations available. Say you must visit Hokkaido to take out a Syndicate leader, but if you're 'lucky' to get the Patient Zero scenario, you now have to avoid getting sick with the deadly virus, and the new map changes. It would make for a much more fun and exciting experience, because currently it's pretty much predictable.

## HITMAN III
HITMAN 3/HITMAN World of Assassination, outside of the Freelancer mode is just...fine. I LOVE Dartmoor, especially in Freelancer, but overall it's amazing. I feel like stealth is much better on Dartmoor compared to maps like Chongqing or Ambrose Island. The H3 campaign's final level, Romania, feels like a lost chance to make 47 return to the Institute of Human Betterment to take out the map's main target. I don't know, I don't dislike that we have a train level and that it's highly linear, but I feel like it could have been MUCH better.

## Main maps
The main maps that I like from H3 are Dartmoor, Berlin and Mendoza. I love the Mastery 20 suit from Dartmoor, I'd buy one in real life, the British countryside atmosphere is very good, Berlin's much darker soundtrack and overall atmosphere makes for a great stealth experience, and Mendoza is just so nice. I love the tango music, I love the setting of the map, the characters are pretty good and have multiple proper scenarios to die, I think I might have spent about 50 hours of non-Steam playtime just on this map alone, with another 20-30 on Steam. Dubai is meh, it's a great tutorial map, Romania is meh, and Chongqing isn't up to my taste, although I can't say it's bad, because the lightning and the rain are great. I just wish now that rain exists as a feature, they might have backported it to Haven Island's stormy weather.

## Ambrose Island
The new Ambrose Island is alright I suppose, it's supposed to be somewhere between Whittleton Creek or Mumbai and Isle of Sgail lore-wise. It's a nice setting, but I'm pretty terrible at trying to stealth through it, and most of the times just end up going in loud.

## VR mode
The VR mode is still terrible. Not much has been done about it, PSVR2 support is missing, and because they still broke their promise from the reveal trailer about reloading your weapons. In the trailer, reloading weapons was done by hand, but it's done at the press of a button in-game. Considering many first-person VR games with guns exist - Half-Life: Alyx, Boneworks, Pavlov VR - and they allow players to reload weapons by hand, there's no excuse for this. HITMAN is supposed to be immersive and realistic.

I still hold my position that HITMAN 3 is pretty weak and disappointing, but it does have some great moments. The lore is good, I love a certain cutscene in Chongqing's ICA facility and a certain cutscene in Mendoza, there's plenty of content now that it's a whole trilogy (even if it's still divided into two editions), it's just underwhelming.

## Past issues that might still be issues in the next Hitman/IOI game
I didn't forget about the server issues the game had at launch, for both the Demo and the full game. The game was literally unplayable at launch because of the stupid always-online connectivity requirement, and their lazy excuse was 'to prevent hacking'. The leaderboards' top positions are literally filled with hackers, your always-online crap doesn't work. I use Cheat Engine to modify my weapons' ammo amount and the game doesn't check against the 'server' or anything to see if it's alright for the weapon to have 999999523 bullets in a single magazine. IO Interactive also brokered a one year exclusivity deal with Epig Games Store. PC exclusives are cancer, and should not exist. I get the existence of some console exclusives (e.g. Halo, Horizon, God of War, Forza Horizon, Spider-Man) but there's no reasoning for PC exclusives outside of using a much crappier launcher and store with subpar features that pretends to compete with Steam.

## Offline mode
I truly hope that at the end of Year Three, with a winter update, HITMAN World of Assassination will have most of its features - challenges, past Elusive Targets and other content that requires Internet connectivity - to be ported or made available offline. There's not a chance the servers won't be shut down for HITMAN WoA in like 5 years at most, while HITMAN and HITMAN 2's servers in probably 1-3 years.

## Overall review
Overall, HITMAN World of Assassination and HITMAN 3 are somewhere between fine and great in my opinion. It's not deserving of any GOTY awards or nominations, as it's not groundbreaking or as dark lore-wise as I might have expected, but it's not a forgettable experience either. The game is still the best place to play all 3 games, ESPECIALLY because of the small 80GB size compared to HITMAN 2 Gold + GOTY Legacy Pack being 150GB and HITMAN GOTY being 60GB on PC.

## Any potential big updates
I would love for IOI to create one last big update before the end of Year Three, as I think it's the last year of 'proper' support for HITMAN World of Assassination. I'd love a new campaign similar to Patient Zero, as that campaign was oh so good, in my opinion. Heck, I'd love to have the Sarajevo Six on PC and XBOX, but that's probably not happening, ever, due to a pretty restrictive contract between IOI/Square Enix and SONY that would keep The Sarajevo Six on HITMAN (2016) an exclusive for PlayStation 4. So, if a new campaign or TSS aren't viable, then fixing my gripes with Freelancer, and adding things like random ToD and as many scenarios to the maps as possible would be satisfactory.

## Pricing
If possible, buy the game on sale instead of full price.

Buy it at a lower cost, don't pay more than $60 on this thing. IOI clearly moved most resources to Project 007 and Project Dragon, and with the May update, there's not much content on the horizon in Year Three for HITMAN World of Assassination. I eagerly await the next Hitman game, even if it would be a remake.

## Still a negative review
I still maintain my review as a negative review, mostly because this is supposed to be a review for HITMAN 3, not WoA. It's still an underwhelming product that might have been a little overhyped, VR isn't a great experience at all, and the newly introduced Freelancer and Ambrose Island content aren't much better either.
