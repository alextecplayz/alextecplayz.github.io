*I stumbled upon one of AsianHalfSquat's videos, where he showcased a new datapack that is, in my opinion, the holy grail of Minecraft world generation. Combine this with something like Complementary Shaders, and you've got yourself an amazing time in Minecraft.*

## What does Terralith add?
Terralith adds over 50 new biomes, and modifies most of Minecraft's own biomes and caves, and completely transforms the way the map looks. And get this: it doesn't add any new blocks, it just works!

## Review
I have tested Terralith on Minecraft 1.17.1 with OptiFabric (Fabric with a mod that supports OptiFine, sort of a Minecraft Forge, but with better performance) and I have to say, from the beginning, this datapack is a game changer.

![A subtle sunset can be seen towards the middle right of the image. In the distance, through the fog, a Plains and Savanna swamp island can be seen. The player is sitting on the shore of a Plains biome peninsula.](https://i.ibb.co/tzJ5Ykh/2021-08-08-15-52-45.png "A subtle sunset can be seen towards the middle right of the image.

*A beautiful sunset*

I spawned in a spruce forest, in a different place than the actual world spawn, Terralith says it's to 'diversify' the world generation, and to spawn you in a unique place.

Sadly I do not have a screenshot of the forest itself, it wasn't really different from anything in normal Minecraft, apart from a few small oak fence trees (like you'd see in some Minecraft builds, sort of like little palms), and about 6 very, very tall spruce trees, probably 50-60 blocks tall. After a while, I have stumbled upon the place from the image below, and I have continued forward, only to find a very nice swamp island, and I have to say, I'm already impressed.

*Seeing the swamp island*

![A Plains biome swamp island, seen at night. Ahead there are many swamp oak trees, providing a lot of shadow, making the image very dark.](https://i.ibb.co/z26Xqf9/2021-08-08-15-54-55.png "A Plains biome swamp island, seen at night.

*On the island*

I swear, this looks fantastic. Combined with the nice SSR (screenspace reflections) and the amazing shadows and light the Complementary Shaders provide, it's a sight to behold. Moving forward, I found a pond on the island, with small logs and lily pads floating on it.

![A Plains biome swamp lagoon seen at night, overlooking the water and some swamp trees. Some mushrooms, floating oak logs and lily pads are seen.](https://i.ibb.co/X8CXdsn/2021-08-08-15-55-11.png "A Plains biome swamp lagoon seen at night, overlooking the water and some swamp trees.

*Swamp lagoon*

*Floating logs*

After looking around this island, I swam to the shore, and moved up a hill, only to find a very grassy plains field and a village.

![A village in the Plains biome, which is extremely grassy, seen at night from the sky. The village is lit up.](https://i.ibb.co/SKqZm7r/2021-08-08-15-55-59.png "A village in the Plains biome, which is extremely grassy, seen at night from the sky. The village is lit up.")

*Plains village, and a LOT of grass!*

OK, enough chit-chat and weird silly story, here's more images, and then my final words on this datapack.

## Final words on the datapack
Terralith is a game changer, it feels natural but also new, there's a lot of biomes to see and admire, there's more things to do if you ever get bored of normal Minecraft gameplay, or the normal world generation, and it's a worthy competitor to the upcoming Minecraft 1.18 world generation update (Caves & Cliffs Part II), coming this holiday. Go check out Terralith for yourself, and enjoy possibly THE best world generation change in Minecraft.
