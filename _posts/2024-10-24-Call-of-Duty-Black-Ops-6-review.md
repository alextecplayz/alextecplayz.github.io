## TLDR
A certain improvement over Modern Warfare Ⅲ (which received a [scathing 3/10 rating from me](http://alextecplayz.github.io/post/2023/11/04/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-III-Review.html), and many others), and a certainly good campaign, Call of Duty Black Ops 6 does manage to capture that conspiratorial atmosphere yet again. While it doesn't come quite close to Black Ops Cold War's campaign (9/10 rating from me), it's still a damn good, memorable campaign. Is Call of Duty back? Yes, yes it is.

If I had to rate only the campaign (as I do in this article), it's an 8/10. If I had to rate the whole game (Campaign + MP + Zombies), it's a 7/10. $70 is way too much for this. If I could only pay for the campaign, it would be much better (*especially if it would be playable on Linux through Proton, at the very least*), at a $25-30 price tag. The only modern campaign I'd be willing to spend more on than this would be BOCW, which could be sold for $45 and still be damn great.

## Soundtrack
It may seem weird that I'd start off by going over the soundtrack, but I can't help but praise it. Composed by Jack Wall (which composed Black Ops Cold War's *truly excellent* soundtrack), I can pinpoint exactly the songs which use instruments, jingles, tunes or themes previously heard in BOCW. For example, [39. The Pantheon](https://open.spotify.com/track/7I2qYZhD8EyU5ZBkVVGH9z?si=72527b5535d6484b) echoes the mysterious, conspiratorial undertones of [5. New Beginnings](https://open.spotify.com/track/4YuV8rRe9Wjix9Mm9rRhx8?si=34e0699c7e0247a3), [6. No Higher Duty](https://open.spotify.com/track/0PHkMMuvP5BP1L0E8RQhen?si=c54cbeca473746c1), and [46. Who Am I?](https://open.spotify.com/track/18tZdIq6kx4bsqWLJFkxjH?si=5297486770e6448f), among others, while adding its own twists as well. The Pantheon also has a sci-fi retro-futurist jingle that helps push the conspiratorial theme of an organization (Pantheon) effectively overtaking and sabotaging the CIA. Then, as it moves on, it picks up a more action-packed, Spider-Man-esque orchestral theme that blends in with the rest of the soundtrack, as it's mainly supposed to resemble an action blockbuster-kind of vibe, unlike Cold War which went all in on the mystery.

[40. Find Harrow](https://open.spotify.com/track/2StVaG3cNfBOTANuLyjEKX?si=65d3cd962f2c49d7) seems to have a more 'streamlined' atmosphere, in the sense of the modern installments of Call of Duty sharing some kind of soundtrack themes and notes between each other, such as Modern Warfare, Modern Warfare II and of course, Cold War. This isn't limited to Call of Duty, however. Games such as the HITMAN World of Assassination trilogy also manage to have a consistent theme that each game's soundtrack relies on to keep a similar experience when you'd, if ever, 'binge play' the games by following the whole main story of the trilogy. Still, it packs a punch and sounds superb. It manages to capture quite well the atmosphere of the game

[42. Fractured Memories](https://open.spotify.com/track/3xMAB6Mum1q7TkqXmR6iXV?si=5aec590e8d474ac9) heavily returns to Cold War themes, [47. Ruộng lúa ba](https://open.spotify.com/track/3CMTczAIXHWyNZa3XrISRt?si=0f6df76880ef4bde) from BOCW immediately comes to mind. It shares the same theme, of exploring oneself, and figuring out their history, or reliving old memories.

I'm sorry, if you couldn't tell by now, I'm a massive fan of Jack Wall's work on BOCW and BO6. He manages to keep everything consistent, fluent and expressive throughout both soundtracks, no matter what. The BOCW & BO6 soundtracks could be praised endlessly, but I need to talk about the other stuff too.

**Beyond this point, this section contains spoilers about both Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. You have been warned!**

## Story

Yeah, the story is great, actually! What's better than a high-stakes, action-packed story, AND a conspiracy about the CIA being infiltrated by an entity seeking to ruin it? BO6 takes a page out of BOCW's book, where "Bell" was revealed to have been brainwashed, and to have actually worked for Perseus. Well, in BO6 the main protagonist controlled by the player, William "Case" Calderon, has apparently experienced 'The Cradle' a decade before the events of the game, as is revealed when Case visits the Advanced Technologies and Applications' bunker and inhales the gas, which results in a hallucination of the ATAA Division with a wonderful lobby reminiscent of Soviet-era retro-futurist architecture.

But let's rewind back. In 1989 during the US invasion of Panama, Raul Menendez kills their handler, Jason Hudson, and tricks Frank Woods into killing Alex Mason. Russel Adler is soon framed as one of Menendez' moles in the CIA, which forces Adler to go rogue. In 1991, during the early beginnings of *Operation Desert Storm* and thus, the Gulf War, Troy Marshall, "Case" and Jane Harrow go on a mission to extract the Iraqi Secretary Sayeed Awali near the Iraq-Kuwait border, where they find the existence of, and fight troops belonging to, Pantheon. After fending off Pantheon troops, Russel Adler shows up instead of the supposed 'contact' that Troy had, executes Awali claiming that neither Pantheon or the CIA (Langley) should get their hands on Awali, and delivers a message to Woods before extracting the group. Back at the CIA, the group's supervisor, Livingstone, finds it very hard to believe the rumours about Pantheon, and suspends the group, being especially motivated by Awali's fate.

Woods recognises Adler's message which leads the group (Troy and "Case") to go rogue and operate out of an abandoned KGB safehouse in Bulgaria. At the safehouse, they discover evidence pointing to a technical genius, Felix Neumann, and assassin Sevati "Sev" Dumas. Troy tracks down and recruits Felix, while "Case" travels to Avalon to recruit Sevati after sniping one target and helping Sevati kill two more crime bosses from the area, all three related in some way to Pantheon, being part of a criminal organisation named "The Guild", which Sev worked for in the past. (*Side note: Avalon is not a real location, it's tied to a legend, however Avalon in the Call of Duty universe is a location in the Mediterranean area*).

Then, we return to Washington D.C., in the mission that was premiered on YouTube, "Most Wanted", where Troy, Sev, "Case" and Felix bust out Adler from a CIA safehouse underneath the Capitol Station, which is hosting a political event for none other than Bill Clinton! After breaking out Adler, Pantheon attacks the crew again, and they get blamed for the attack on the station rather than Pantheon, which seeks to erase any and all traces of themselves from the news.

Adler reveals that Pantheon has had weapon deals with Saddam Hussein, and contacts his source in the MI6, Helen Park, previously seen in BOCW, which manages to delay the British SAS attacks on a palace in order for Troy, Adler and "Case" to investigate the palace's bunker. In the bunker, they discover "the Cradle" an American bioweapon manufactured in Kentucky, under the Advanced Technologies and Applications division, and the name of the head scientist working for Pantheon, Matvey Gusev.

"Case", Marshall and Sev investigate the biolab, but "Case" gets separated and inhales "the Cradle"'s hallucinogenic gas which takes us on a trip throughout the abandoned lab, as "Case" fights off zombies, four zombie bosses in order to retrieve four keycards, and mannequins. And, I have to say, the entire mission is fantastic. The architecture is reminiscent of DEATHLOOP-esque retro-futurist with a blend of Soviet-era brutalism, which works really well. We find out, through a voice that "Case" hears, and through information we find around the lab sectors including phone calls with the supposed scientists praising Case and the outcome of the test, that "Case" isn't just a nickname for William, but also the name used when William was the one and only test subject to be exposed to "the Cradle", "Test Subject Case One", before the whole project was shut down by none other than Livingstone, due to concerns about the project, which in turn was also supposed to shut down Pantheon, the secret CIA division that oversaw the development of the performance-enhancing drug. After this 'seizure', as reported by Troy and Sev when "Case" regains his senses, the team discovers that Pantheon already stole most of the biolab stores regarding the Cradle, however they manage to find a recording which reveals that Harrow is working for the Pantheon, which leads them on a mission back in Avalon, infiltrating a casino where they manage to steal financial records that reveal Pantheon is wiring money to Gusev in Iraq. After a brief chase and gunfights at an Iraqi airport, they catch up to Gusev, where he informs the team about the Cradle being stored in Vorkuta.

The Vorkuta mission can be approached in multiple ways, as many of the other missions in BO6, but while the team can't stop "the Cradle" from being moved, they finally capture Harrow for questioning. Back at the safehouse, Adler injects her with a truth serum which is somehow connected to MK-Ultra, and Harrow slowly reveals that Adler may have murdered her parents for being double (or triple?)-agents - which could be just a hallucination, as she was very young when both parents were assassinated in their family home. Besides that, we find out that "the Cradle" was always planted inside the Capitol Building, and is waiting for her command to deploy, which could infect tens of thousands of people in the area. Pantheon's ultimate plan was a false-flag operation to discredit the CIA and install Harrow as the new Director of the agency. While all of this is happening, the team is also defending the safehouse from Pantheon forces in multiple waves.

Pantheon successfully manages to raid the house, where they free Harrow which stabs Woods in the stomach (presumably), before evacuating to a helicopter. "Case" manages to catch up and board the helicopter as it prepares for takeoff, and a close-combat fight ensues between Harrow and Case. Harrow pulls a gun, and accidentally shoots the Helicopter pilot while struggling to fend off "Case", and the helicopter crashes. Harrow reveals (after privately taunting Case back in Vorkuta), that she knows about Case being part of the project, and that he "owes everything to the Pantheon", while punching him in the face. "Case" grabs "the Cradle" and smashes it on Harrow's face, and thus releasing the gas, which leads Case to ultimately strangle Harrow, before presumably drowning, but this is left ambiguous. Troy tries to radio Case, informing him about how Livingstone managed to evacuate everyone in the Capitol building and recover the Cradle, before cutting to a "Two weeks later" cutscene.

In the final cutscene, Livingstone meets the crew ("Case" isn't mentioned or shown at all) in a forest near a river, and informs them about how they're living in the shadows, and how Livingstone needs the team, as he knows that Pantheon is not yet destroyed, and informs Troy that they must head to Avalon to continue pursuing the remnants of the division. The last few scenes show a person in a CIA office accessing the CIA infrastructure through the terminal, before smiling. Some assumed that it was Alex Mason somehow, but it's apparently Pantheon operative *Jackson Caine*, which leads a CIA task force in MP, as they hunt down and undermine the efforts of the rogue Black Ops team led by Woods.

So, Activision is continuing the BO6 storyline first through MP/Warzone, similar to what happened with BOCW and previous installments before they'd tease what comes next for the Black Ops series, I think that's fine.

Yeah, the story is a wild ride, but it's executed quite well and there's little to complain about. I just wish we'd know more about "Case", because the crew never seems to wonder about his past, nor do they respond when Harrow directly tells Case in Vorkuta about knowing who he is, besides the "Don't listen to her, Case!" from Troy. The reveal that Harrow was the 'big bad' wasn't really that surprising to anyone, it seems. It's all quite formulaic, but at least it does have some twists to keep it fresh and engaging. The VO performance was splendid as well, I have no complaints there.

Overall, I'm quite pleased with how the BO6 campaign turned out, the marketing was mostly on point and didn't really over-hype what would happen in the game.
