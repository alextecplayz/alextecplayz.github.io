## What is it
The new feature is called Seek, and it's a gesture on the video screen. Slide your finger either right or left to scrub to a certain point in the video. When the gesture is activated, a pop message appears on the screen that reads, “Slide left or right to seek.”

## Flaws
Accidents. Sliding your finger by mistake, possibly to clean your screen from dust and dirt will make the video almost always send you to the beginning or the end of the video, requiring you to either slide again, more accurately back to where you were previously, or to scrub on the seek bar, because YouTube felt it was unnecessary to have a basic feature of just tapping where you want to go on the video.
