## TLDR
Sloppy, lazy and uninspired, Modern Warfare Ⅲ's story is filled with shallow characters, predictable cliches, and the very few good moments cannot hold a candle to previous games in the series. Their attempt to innovate the campaign by introducing 'Open Combat Missions' fails miserably, as it's painfully obvious it's the DMZ mode in singleplayer, and they go as far as to literally lift maps from Warzone and bring them in.

## The Good
+ The cinematic cutscenes look good. Heck, the in-engine cutscenes look pretty good too. Some of the setpieces are also detailed and have detailed VFX
+ The soundtrack sounds nice, some of the songs are really good
+ Weapon models and sounds are as always, detailed, crisp, and generally you will have a great time using them, in both SP and MP

## The Bad
- The game was initially a DLC for Modern Warfare Ⅱ, and even rebranded as a third game in the Modern Warfare Universe, it still feels like a DLC because of the campaign
- Massive game size on PC (149GB unless Call of Duty HQ and Warzone are installed, 213GB with HQ textures) and console
- Could be a bug, but even on the highest settings, the textures look pixelated and blurry
- Unfortunately despite some places where the game looks good, the engine shows its age in some places concerning dynamic lightning and shadows. It's also very unfortunate that there aren't that many object physics either
- Shallow characters that bring no emotion to the player. Soap's death brings the campaign to an abrupt end, and I felt nothing when he was killed by Makarov. I also felt nothing when in the post-credits cutscene, Shepard dies at the hands of captain Price
- Graves is the same character from MWⅡ's campaign, the same shallow 'patriot' that milsimps drool over. His handsome appearance cannot save the fact that he's ultimately not a very interesting character outside a few cutscenes
- Makarov seems very toned down, his face can be compared to an infant, his cutscenes are cringeworthy and sleep-inducing
- The game plays it safe yet again. While I didn't expect the developers to re-make infamous missions such as 'No Russian', the very few missions and cutscenes concerning civilian casualties or terrorist attacks are short, have no weight or emotional depth
- The campaign as a whole is convoluted, seemingly coming to an abrupt end for whatever reason, and is generally very short. If you have played Call of Duty games before, and are quite good at the game, or trying to speedrun it, you could finish it in less than 3 hours. Regular players will finish the campaign in less than 6 hours
- The campaign also feels rushed, and I assume it is one of the reasons it comes to such an abrupt end. It's that there was not enough time to continue developing it
- When I thought Modern Warfare Ⅱ's campaign was weak, I did not expect Ⅲ's campaign to be even weaker, possibly one of the weakest and worst campaigns in the entire series
