**I will review the game on a MAP-BY-MAP basis, for all three games in the World of Assassination trilogy in this review.**

## HITMAN (2016) maps
- RECOMMENDED (generally)

### ICA Facility, Greenland - RECOMMENDED
Before i begin on this, yes, the facility is located in Greenland. Quote from the HITMAN Wiki:"Greenland is the location of the ICA Facility, where 47 was recruited back in 1999."

The location is excellent as a training mission. You get to play a map twice, where you can attempt the assassination of the target in multiple ways, to get you accommodated with the features of HITMAN (2016), and a final test map, where you can also find multiple ways to eliminate the target, and an escalation, not really that great, but it's good.

### Paris, France - RECOMMENDED
Another mission that feels like a tutorial, and a James Bond movie. Everything is placed how it should, nothing looks out of place and everything has been almost meticulously checked before the map was released, therefore barely any bugs.

### Sapienza, Italy - RECOMMENDED
Meticulously crafted, a true masterpiece of a map. It's gorgeous, it looks pretty accurate to the real-life counterpart.

### Marrakesh, Morocco - NOT RECOMMENDED
It's a good map, yes, but the crowds and the targets aren't really that good.

### Bangkok, Thailand - NOT RECOMMENDED
It's very boring, the head turning is a bigger issue here.

### Colorado, USA - NOT RECOMMENDED
It's a map with 99% of its NPCs guards. 30 guards in a zone, another 30 somewhere else, another 30 in the house area and another 10 guards in ANOTHER zone. The map is literally filled with the bastards, everything you do can start a full-blown fight and you will easily die, no matter the difficulty. If you don't have good or even near-perfect aim (like me and other good HITMAN players), then you cannot reach 100% completion. At the time of writing, i can't finish 4 challenges because they're bugged, so I'm stuck at 96% completion on this crap.

### Hokkaido, Japan - RECOMMENDED
This is a truly zen map, after the atrocity of Colorado. You can literally relax here, I would visit this IRL if it would exist like this tbh. There are guards, but they're not littered about every corner, you can't use crowbars or lockpicks on the doors, although there are locked cases and safes.


## HITMAN (2016) GOTY Missions - Patient Zero
- RECOMMENDED (generally)

### PZ Bangkok, Thailand - NOT RECOMMENDED
It's Bangkok, but at night time, and the 2 targets are in the same place with dozens of guards by them, plus the hotel's security team.

### PZ Sapienza, Italy - RECOMMENDED
Sapienza at night time, a sick soundtrack and 2 targets that meet at midnight (8 minutes since the start of the mission), not a crap ton of guards, a zen map as well.

### PZ Colorado, USA - RECOMMENDED
This version of Colorado is good. It's midday, and you snipe the targets from a tower, while the guards cannot shoot you. You have to use the information provided by your Handler to find and eliminate four of the targets, the fifth target is preferred to be eliminated last.

### PZ Hokkaido, Japan - RECOMMENDED
Zen, sadly there's more guards and NPCs in the hospital section of the map, higher security, sick soundtrack and the finale of the Patient Zero campaign.


## HITMAN 2 Standard Edition
- RECOMMENDED (generally)

### Hawke's Bay, New Zealand - RECOMMENDED
I would literally buy that house if it would exist, it's very modern and it's looking amazing. Target is good, but not great, and there's an easter egg elimination if you kill all of the guards on the map (not that many anyways).

### Miami, USA - RECOMMENDED
Excellent, zen, it has a lot of guards, yes, it's understandable though. You're eliminating two targets, one prefers to stay in the Kronstadt building, and the other is racing, after which will be walking around the bars next to the event area/stadium?

### Santa Fortuna, Colombia - NOT RECOMMENDED
Head turning is an issue, the targets are too spread out, the map is too big, the soundtrack is good.

### Mumbai, India - RECOMMENDED
Literally speechless. It's an amazing map, with everything done right. Yes, there's three targets spread out again, but it's a much more calculated approach, with 3 types of guards for each target and the city security, tons of NPCs and crowds, it will NOT run on a weak CPU and a weak GPU.

### Whittleton Creek, USA - RECOMMENDED
Zen, calming, the soundtrack is good, the targets aren't really that great, but overall a good map.

### Isle of Sgail, United Kingdom - RECOMMENDED
Before I begin on this, yes, the Isle of Sgail is located in Scotland, United Kingdom, but the game does not disclose this.
Amazing map. It looks stunning, check my Screenshots and the Artwork pages on my profile, the targets are good, not great.


## HITMAN 2 Gold Edition
- RECOMMENDED (generally)

### New York, USA - RECOMMENDED
Smaller map, one target, different tiers of security.

### Haven Island, The Maldives - RECOMMENDED
Excellent, a very relaxing map. Something of a good and worthy sequel to Hokkaido.

### SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS - RECOMMENDED (2 out of 3)
#### SAS Miami, USA - RECOMMENDED
Moderate difficulty, feels like a second Patient Zero campaign
#### SAS Santa Fortuna, Colombia - NOT RECOMMENDED
Santa Fortuna itself is terrible in HITMAN 2, this makes it worse, with more guards and a stupid target.
#### SAS Whittleton Creek, USA- RECOMMENDED
Zen mission, moderate difficulty.


## HITMAN III
- NOT RECOMMENDED (generally)

### Dubai, United Arab Emirates - RECOMMENDED
Tutorial-like map, amazing soundtrack.

### Dartmoor, United Kingdom - RECOMMENDED
Bloody good, a very nice looking map.

### Berlin, Germany - RECOMMENDED
Zen, 10 targets, 5 targets must be killed, other 5 can be killed too.

### Chongqing, China - NOT RECOMMENDED
Large map, different tiers of security, sick soundtrack though.

### Mendoza, Argentina - RECOMMENDED
Excellent, the best map in this third installment.

### Carpathian Mountains, Romania - NOT RECOMMENDED
I like the map, it's a moving train, but it's extremely linear, unlike virtually every map in the WOA trilogy.

### HITMAN III DLCs?
Do NOT get the Seven Sins DLC, it's not worth even $10
