## TLDR
***Far Cry 6 is the perfect slop to play for dozens of hours, with no emotion or depth. It's sadly the most marketable Far Cry game content-wise to date.***

With almost 200 hours under my belt, I can still play the game endlessly, but I will never feel anything worthwhile. It's just another mediocre game with the same overused Ubisoft formula, now with some additional useless, half-baked features, story, motifs, characters and poor game design. It can be FUN, but only because everything is so silly and stupid.

The series as a whole was never very good, and none of the games would get a score higher than 7/10 from me, but Far Cry 6 is a new low, a 'far cry' from what the series was supposed to be. I was actually hyped for this game, because I like the game's themes and ideas about fascism, the soundtrack, some of the cinematics and trailers, Giancarlo Esposito's performance and typefaces used. This is a disappointment.

Advice: If you want to play the game, ALWAYS buy it on sale, and ALWAYS buy the standard or deluxe edition. The DLCs are not worth any amount of money.

## The Good
+ The Dunia engine is good from a technical standpoint. It has modern features, good performance, the detail is surprisingly good even on the lowest settings (without the HD pack installed)
+ The weapons look very good, the textures are crisp and sharp even on the lowest settings.
+ The volumetric clouds are acceptable, but sometimes look questionable. Regardless, the volumetric cloud technology in Dunia cannot hold a candle to the RAGE engine used in Red Dead Redemption II, or Unreal Engine.
+ The performance of the actors for the 'big characters' - Dani Rojas, Anton Castillo, Juan Cortez, and many others - is very good, especially for Anton Castillo, despite the unfortunately low screen time
+ Most characters actually have some kind of personality, they can be likable and have some charm
+ The soundtrack is quite good, but unfortunately I feel like it could have been better. Most songs use a common tone, but that tone isn't serious enough, and even in its current state, the soundtrack's tone does not match the tone of the game, or the characters
+ The Stranger Things x Far Cry 6 mission (The Vanishing) is actually fantastic, just like the soundtrack. It perfectly combines tones from both the show and the game, and I have listened to it so many times. I'm glad at least one of the crossover missions is good
+ The only good thing I can say about Ubisoft's launcher and approach to achievements, is that some achievements give the player additional in-game rewards such as money (Moneda or Pesos) or cosmetic unlocks for weapons, weapon charms or vehicles
+ Surprisingly good vehicle mechanics, with the exception of helicopter control. Try turning a helicopter in this game, it's going to take ages, unless you have a mouse with a button to adjust its sensitivity/DPI
+ The game runs great on Linux. ALWAYS use Proton Experimental, do not stick to a stable release if you want to play Far Cry 6, as frequent updates to the Ubisoft launcher will render the launcher invisible, and somehow, will prevent the game from ever launching.

## The Bad
- Game is EOL when it comes to updates. The game will never receive AMD FSR2, FSR3, Intel XeSS, or NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, that could massively improve performance on all systems.
- The other two crossover missions, centered around Rambo and Danny Trejo are subpar and mediocre. There's nothing memorable about them.
- The 'Lost Worlds' DLC is convoluted, dumb and is not worth any amount of money. Do not buy any of them.
- The Season Pass, or the DLC episodes - Vaas: Insanity, Pagan: Control, Joseph: Collapse - are equally dumb and not worth any amount of money.
- Unfortunately, this 'character personality' goes out the door when it comes to killing. Imagine, if you will, the same happy-go-lucky people that would dance, sing and drink all day and night would, in a moment's notice, become mercenaries capable of killing hundreds of soldiers. It just doesn't 'click' at all. The characters are also occasionally cringy and seem too happy and cheerful for the supposedly serious tone of the game.
- The 'fascist' Yara seems to be so weak. Excluding one mission story, the full military force of the FND is never shown. Even in that mission, it's not really anything impressive, it's just dozens of soldiers and a PG-240 missile.
- Anton is a cookie-cutter villain with short-sighted greed and plans, a grandiose ego that continuously needs stroking, and it's not really very ruthless for a supposedly 'fascist' dictator. There was so much potential regarding his role in the game, but it all ends in such a stupid way, that it doesn't even manage to be memorable.
- Denuvo will always be a negative. I still strongly believe a game's performance is worse with Denuvo, for the simple objective reason that Denuvo encrypts and decrypts game data ON THE FLY, which is obviously bound to have performance drawbacks. Fuck Denuvo.
- The game takes a MONOLITHIC 171GB of storage with all content installed (136GB download) (base game ~ 60GB, optional HD textures - 59GB, the rest is DLC and other language localization files). This size will still be an issue, even after disabling the HD texture download. It's because there is no configuration in the game's Steam depots for the additional DLCs, so you will end up with 111GBs, and you will have to manually slim it down by removing the additional content and languages if you don't need them. Games should NEVER download additional content you do not own, especially if the additional content is gigabytes and gigabytes of precious storage.
- Even if the game looks good asset-wise, the experience is rather dull and boring. I don't know why, but it's a similar issue I have with Mafia 3. The game somehow looks washed out at certain times of day, such as noon.
- The Dunia engine's good performance still leaves a lot to be desired. The game just doesn't HAVE as much detail as other games, so it should perform much better than it currently does. For example, on my GTX 1650 (running on Linux!), on the lowest settings, 1080P + FSR1 Ultra Quality, I get somewhere between 30-70FPS, most of the time it's a smooth 50-60. In contrast, Red Dead Redemption II would run somewhere around 30-70FPS as well, but mostly somewhere between 30-40FPS, and the game has a lot more detail on the lowest setting.
- Mediocre game story with some peaks, but mostly mids and a few lows. The motifs and themes regarding propaganda, truth/lies are massively under-utilized, and it all gets ruined by the un-serious tone of the characters. Everything feels rushed, overlooked and quickly abandoned.
- The game feels empty. NPCs don't feel lively, or do anything remotely interesting. They all walk from place to place, although it might not be as obvious as the atrocious NPCs from Cyberpunk 2077. In my old review, I compared the liveliness' to GTA San Andreas, where the NPCs feel much more alive, more fluid and more immersive.
- Following a video comparison, Far Cry 6 seems to be a Destiny-like game, with some RPG elements that were first added to Far Cry: New Dawn. I have never noticed this, seeing as how I'm not a fan of RPG games, nor have I played the Far Cry titles that aren't part of the main lineup (e.g. Primal, New Dawn)
- The various ammo types are useless. I have used the blast rounds twice in the game, but otherwise I have always used the armor piercing rounds, as I have frequently used stealth, high ground and headshots or melee kills in combat. They wouldn't be useful anyways, even if I were to use a different tactic. The incendiary rounds are so weak, and their implementation is so incredibly stupid. The enemy is on fire, but they keep shooting you, and the fire will put itself out in a matter of seconds. This isn't how incendiary rounds work, Ubisoft, and you probably know that already
- Like any other modern Ubisoft game, Far Cry 6 is designed around microtransactions, and the illusion of 'play time' that would make the player believe that it was worth spending so much money on the game and/or additional content (DLC) or microtransactions
- TOO MUCH USELESS SIDE CONTENT! It's so delusionally tedious and frustrating to get everything if you're a completionist. Some of the treasure hunts are genuinely alright, they seem to have some care put in, but at the end it's just some dumb cosmetic reward such as a gun pendant or some dumb, underpowered exclusive version of a weapon that I will never use. While you won't completely bore yourself, or have a burnout while trying to collect everything, you won't feel good either, save for very few moments when you have to complete quite decent puzzles to get some of the collectibles.
- The addition of PG-240 / PG-240X feels rather forced. Coupled with the claims that Yara keeps the secret formula to themselves, but then they reveal the ingredients and the manufacturing process of the chemical to a private press release shows that Anton's decision to keep PG-240 exclusive to Yara is just a dumb, and useless measure, as the press, and the three-letter agencies from the USA, China or Russia would get their hands on the secrets sooner or later, and would manufacture it for themselves
- The Ubisoft launcher is functionally useless, and serves no purpose other than to gatekeep your access behind an additional step. Even if you buy the game on Steam, you WILL have to use their launcher before launching the game. This can take minutes on a hard drive, and Ubisoft launcher updates can actually PREVENT you from playing the game on Linux, as the launcher window will be invisible outside of a slim black frame and shadow. Unless you always use Proton Experimental (in the experimental branch) to ensure the latest support and fixes for Uplay, you will not be able to play the game. Do NOT use regular Proton or Proton-GE, it's not worth the hassle to continuously update to a newer version manually. The ONLY acceptable game launcher is a launcher similar to the one used for the HITMAN World of Assassination trilogy. No account, no useless features, instant launch, the launcher only acts as a way for you to benchmark and edit your game settings without launching the actual game, because you don't always want to launch a game to change one setting
- In similar fashion to the embarrassing enemy AI used in the 2020 Watch_Dogs: Legion, Far Cry 6's enemies are essentially BLIND. As long as you have no line of sight, you can hide behind a literal pole and avoid detection. You can shoot enemies in front of other enemies, and you will not get detected. It's extremely easy to run away from any car chases, similar to the embarrassing police chases from Cyberpunk 2077 and its DLC
- Anything more than $15-20 is unacceptable for Far Cry 6. The absurd $100 'Game of the Year' edition is an absolute cash grab. The game didn't even get nominated for GOTY, to warrant such an edition in the first place
