Writing this article is boiling my blood. Hopefully it boils your blood as well, reading it. Fuck this.

## Lia Savonea is a vile piece of shit

**The only candidate at the Romanian Supreme Court at this time is Lia Savonea**, **a vile piece of shit**, and it's beyond me that she's even allowed to be a judge in the first place!

**Short background on Lia Savonea:** Former chief of the Superior Council of Magistracy and former president of the Bucharest Court of Appeals, she was named in association with the Cătălin Voicu network in justice — he was arrested by DNA prosecutors after dismantling his network of politicians, businessmen, and magistrates from the High Court, coordinated by former PSD ("Social-Democratic Party") senator Cătălin Voicu. He was sentenced to 7 years of detention for corruption. Her husband and lawyer, Mihai Savonea, had his law firm in the same building as Cătălin Voicu and a lawyer, Cezar Bivolaru, one of Marian Vanghelie's defendants.

In 2023, she was promoted to the Supreme Court (ro: ÎCCJ - Înaltea Curte de Casaţie şi Justiţie) following an interview DESPITE former Justice Minister Stelian Ion's mention that **Lia Savonea had sentenced a man that sexually abused his 13-year-old granddaughter to ONLY 8 months in prison (with suspension), justifying that the minor gave her consent!** [More information here, in Romanian](https://www.g4media.ro/exclusiv-document-lia-savonea-candidatul-pentru-inalta-curte-care-a-emis-o-sentinta-de-8-luni-de-inchisoare-cu-suspendare-pentru-act-sexual-cu-un-minor-justificand-ca-fetita-si-a-dat-consimtamantul.html), and explained below as well:

The other judge listed in the de-anonymized screenshot, Daniel Grădinaru, is the current president of the CSM, and is considered in the justice system as "Lia Savonea's man".

Part of the court decisions is this hallucinatory paragraph present in the document (not in the photo above) (translated to English):

> *It is true that the deed for which the defendant was convicted presents a certain gravity and following its committing the psycho-social development of the injured person could be negatively affected, but the Court, also holds the circumstance that the injured person did not understand to initiate any action against the behavior, not even to the child, to the police on the occasion of its disappearance from home in October (...) when he moved to the home of his concubine, the witness (...) with whom he intended to marry.*

So, according to Lia Savonea, the girl (13 at the time, so a FUCKING minor!) is partly to blame as well for being abused by that *degenerate fuckwad*, who was also *her uncle*! So, because the police wasn't notified, and the parents didn't know, it's somehow considered as a *consensual sexual act*. Despite the FUCKING FACT THAT **SHE WAS THIRTEEN**. And that an **8 MONTH SENTENCE** for this vile piece of shit is a-okay. It's just enough for him to learn his lesson and never fuck kids again, surely!

**[And this is DESPITE the law that was passed in December 2022, a modification to the Penal Code that classified ANY act with a minor under the age of 16 as RAPE!](https://www.g4media.ro/modificare-importanta-la-codul-penal-actul-sexual-cu-un-minor-sub-16-ani-va-fi-considerat-viol-comisia-juridica-din-camera-deputatilor-a-dat-raport-favorabil-unei-initiative-privind-cresterea-consi.html)**

**This girl would be considered, BY THE LAW, to have been raped by her uncle, but this vile, steaming pile of human excrement, this "judge" is STILL fucking eligible (and IS a candidate, the ONLY candidate) for the Supreme Court of Romania! I'm surprised she can be a judge in the first place!**

**And this is not the only case that has attracted negative attention towards Lia Savonea.**

As part of the ÎCCJ, **she has also taken part in the conspiracy that annulled the final sentencing decision in the case of Mario Iorgulescu** and ordered his re-judgment for manslaughter in the case (file) of the road accident that resulted in the death of a young man. **Mario Iorgulescu was both drunk and on drugs (cocaine) at the time of the accident**.

> **Context:** ([from the G4Media article dated 12 June 2025](https://www.g4media.ro/mario-iorgulescu-beneficiaza-de-inca-o-reducere-a-condamnarii-desi-nu-a-facut-nicio-zi-de-inchisoare-curtea-de-apel-bucuresti-a-dispus-joi-scaderea-a-opt-luni-din-condamnarea-de-8-ani-si-8-luni-inc.html)) On the evening of September 8, 2019, Mario Iorgulescu participated in a party thrown by a friend's family in the village of Gulia, Tărtăşeşti commune, where he consumed alcohol. At one point, he learned that his ex-girlfriend, whom he had just separated, was in a club in the Herăstrău Park. Witnesses said that he was constantly arguing on the phone with his ex-girlfriend, he was angry and was screaming, but he promised the host that he would not drive in his current state at the time. At the end of the party, around 2:50 AM, amid a jealousy crisis and in a state of anger, having a measured alcohol level of 1.96 g/l and being under the influence of cocaine, he got in his car, an Aston Martin Model DBS, and left for the Capital.
>
> He entered Bucharest through Chitila, traveling with speeds between 140 km/h and 164 km/h (moments taken by the video cameras on the route), at the intersection between Chitilei highway and Teodor Neagoe street he ran the red light with a speed of 145 km/h, then accelerated by 162 km/h by the time he passed a vehicle that was driving at a slower speed on the first lane. Later, he climbed with the car on the green zone that separates the two directions of traffic on a street, entered the opposite traffic lanes, where he was involved in a head-on collision, at a speed of 143 km/h, with a car driven by a man, who died on the spot.
>
> A few days after the accident, Mario Iorgulescu was transferred by his family to Italy, by a private plane, and admitted to a clinic. He was not heard by prosecutors or magistrates during the criminal prosecution or the trial in court.

A new decision was taken in June 2025, where the court admitted an annulment appeal filed by Mario Iorgulescu's lawyers, who invoked that, for the offense of driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or other substances, the facts were prescribed. The Bucharest Court of Appeals ordered a decrease of eight months on Mario's sentence of 8 years and 8 months of prison received by Mario. Note that the court had previously reduced his sentence multiple times:

- in February 2023, Mario Iorgulescu is sentenced to 15 years and 8 months by the Bucharest Court
- in October 2023, the Bucharest Court of Appeals reduces his sentence to 13 years and 8 months
- in June 2024, part of the conspiracy in which Lia Savonea participated, the ÎCCJ cancels the conviction on the grounds that Iorgulescu should not be tried for murder but for manslaughter, as the offense has lower punishment limits.
- in December 2024, after a re-judgment, the Bucharest Court of Appeals reduces his sentence to 8 years and 8 months.

> **More context:** The prescription of acts in Romanian law, or more commonly known in English as the "statute of limitations", is when after a certain period of time prescribed by law has passed since a criminal act or civil wrong was committed, the right to prosecute or to bring an action to court is extinguished.
>
> The infraction of driving under the influence of alcohol or other substances in Romanian law is treated as a criminal offense with a specific limitation period for prosecuting the crime. The crime consists of operating a vehicle on public roads with a blood alcohol concentration over 0.80 g/l or under the influence of psychoactive substances, punishable by law with imprisonment from 1 to 5 years, or alternatively with a fine (Art. 336 Penal Code). The offense is considered to occur at the moment of driving with the prohibited blood alcohol level, not the time of biological sample collection. Regarding the prescription (statute of limitations) of such offenses, Romanian Penal Code Article 154 regulates the limitation periods for criminal liability. These periods vary between 3 and 15 years depending on the severity and maximum punishment of the crime. For an offense punishable by up to 5 years in prison, the limitation period is generally 5 years from the date of the offense.
>
> In the Mario Iorgulescu case, the Bucharest Court of Appeals recognized that the criminal act of driving under the influence was time-barred due to prescription. This means that the limitation period for prosecuting that specific offense had expired, making it impossible to continue legal proceedings for that infraction alone. This was a basis for reducing his punishment related to that charge.

She was also part of the conspiracy that arrested the lawyer from Arad suspected of ordering the assassination of her father, although a judge from the Court of Appeals had initially rejected the prosecutors' proposal.

**Seeing this person not be a candidate for the Supreme Court is not enough. I want her to be thrown in prison or at least heavily, supremely penalized for these vile, atrocious decisions she's responsible for. She should also lose her license and never be eligible to be a judge ever again or take any position in state- or private-run law practice. I want her excommunicated from the justice arm of Romania! She is, without a doubt, corrupt and incompetent in practicing actual law, only doing things that serve her interests, and protecting abusers!**

**Unfortunately, the public and the citizens can do basically fuck all against her.** I can only raise awareness, because I *wish* I had the money to consult with actual lawyers and NGOs, like any other sensible citizen that wants to fight corruption would do. But even then, there's not much that can be done. Petitions can only raise public awareness and put pressure on the institutions, but they hold no formal legal weight in the appointment process. [DeClic has launched a petition in May 2025 regarding her appointment](https://facem.declic.ro/campaigns/fara-judecatori-toxici-promovati), if it helps, 70,678 people have signed it. Furthermore, there is *no direct legal mechanism* for ordinary citizens to block or appeal an ÎCCJ appointment decided by the CSM. The CSM's decision is final within the domestic judicial system.

> **Context:** The president of ÎCCJ is selected through a competition organized and overseen by the CSM, specifically its Judges Section. Other branches of government, including the President of Romania (currently Nicușor Dan) have only a formal role in the process, typically just signing off on the CSM decision. The President, despite any objections they might have (as of now, Nicușor has no objections in the matter, he will "very probably" sign the appointment), needs to sign the decision either way.

Lia Savonea is the only candidate in this cycle and was appointed after receiving a majority of votes from the CSM, with only one member voting against her. Her appointment is scheduled for a three-year term starting by September 17, 2025. This procedure leaves little direct space for legal or popular contestation after the internal CSM process has concluded.

**From my limited legal knowledge**: Through updated laws in recent years and in force for the 2025 selection, the President of Romania has been removed from the process entirely. The authority to appoint (and revoke) the president of the Supreme Court lies exclusively with the CSM, specifically its Judges' Section. The President has no legal role to sign, veto, or block the appointment. There is no obligation for the President to sign; if the President does nothing or doesn't want to sign, the appointment still takes place, as the CSM's decision is final and fully binding.

We're so fucked with her at the helm of the Supreme Court.
