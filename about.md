## Who am I?
I'm a game, software and web developer, currently working on projects for Android, Windows, Linux and the Web. Sometimes, I'm very lazy, and sometimes I want to do so many darn things, if only I had the time! I'm very creative, considering I probably think of a new project idea almost on a daily basis, yet it's very unfortunate some have to be thrown away or postponed. I browse a lot of Mastodon, and used to browse a lot of Twitter and Reddit.

Keep in mind I am biased, like literally everyone else. I prefer Kaspersky and BitDefender over every single antivirus solution out there, I heavily dislike Tim Sweeney and his latest actions, including the Epic Games Store and his focus on the 'Metaverse'. I heavily dislike the soulless big corporations that care only about money instead of their consumers, I love privacy and security and despise companies like Google, Apple, Facebook/Meta, Amazon. Expect remarks about these companies and topics if we're talking about them in a post here.

I also LOVE science, not just as a whole, but anything related to science will probably interest me. I find urbanism, history, geography, logic, psychology, biology, anatomy, astronomy, physics, chemistry and math most fascinating, but I also love other science or tech things like cryptography, and sometimes look into philosophy, mostly as a curiosity.

## Contact
If you have any questions, suggestions or something else, here's where you can contact me:
-  E-mail: [*alextec70@protonmail.com*](mailto:alextec70@protonmail.com)
-  Mastodon: [*@alextecplayz@techhub.social*](https://techhub.social/@AlexTECPlayz)*
- Matrix: [*@alextecplayz:matrix.org*](https://matrix.to/#/@alextecplayz:matrix.org)
- XMPP: *alextecplayz@conversations.im*

I have accounts on platforms like Instagram (@alextecplayz), reddit (u/TECPlayz2-0) and Twitter (@realTECPlayz), but I don't really use them anymore, especially Twitter or Instagram. If you really must contact me, it's best to message me on Mastodon or send me an email. Alternatively, DM me on reddit, but if you message me on Instagram or Twitter, don't expect to always get fast replies, as I rarely check those platforms nowadays.

Additionally, I have a Discord account (@alextecplayz), but I don't use it outside of inviting some people to playtest my projects. Do not contact me on Discord, I will not respond.
