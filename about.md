Hi! I'm Alex, she/they.

I'm 19, Transfem, Aromantic, Bisexual, Non-Binary, living in Romania for the time being, but I'm split between staying or moving the fuck out of the country due to general bad QoL, bad politics, corruption and climate change. I'm also an Atheist, have been since I was at least 12, but the signs were always there.

## What I do

In my free time, I used to work on games in Unreal Engine using Blueprints, such as [:prisonia:Prisonia](https://vantainteractive.com/en/games/Prisonia), now I very slowly develop my own game engine named [:sapphire:Sapphire](https://docs.vantainteractive.com/en/sapphire/) using C++ (*with additional language support down the road*), work on other software and websites such as [the one you're currently browsing](alextecplayz.github.io), or the [:vi-bw:Vanta Interactive website](https://vantainteractive.com), with it's own subdomains for [:vi-bw:Docs](https://docs.vantainteractive.com), [:vi-bw:Legal](https://legal.vantainteractive.com) and [:vi-bw:Status](https://status.vantainteractive.com). As of July 2024, all of this has slowed down significantly since I'm applying to some places, and will have to work. My free time will be much more limited.

**I exclusively work with the 'raw' languages, I don't use frameworks at all.** I'm the most comfortable with HTML, CSS and JS at the moment, followed by C++ and other languages that I may know less, such as Java, Python3 and whatever leftover knowledge I have of C# nowadays, having used it for 6 months to try out UWP and WinUI development when I was using Windows 10.

I like to tinker with stuff, I sometimes decompile apps through JADX, tinker with stuff such as AI (LLMs, mostly), play around with Blueprints, Widgets in Unreal, have an affinity for adding as much customization to my stuff as possible, and also make some [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@alextecplaz) videos, but they don't have a schedule. I just make things when I can or want.

Another thing I like a lot is science, especially astronomy. I have a fascination with black holes, they're just so mysterious and cool.

I'm also slightly interested in stuff like hormones, psychology and how the human brain works. Could my gender identity, my romantic or sexual orientation be affected by me having (*undiagnosed*) SzPD? Could they be intertwined? Who knows, the human body is a complex machine, and there's so much we still don't know.

## What I do as well

I worked for a month as an on-site freelancer at a small hospital's laboratory section, I worked in Excel, Word, registered lab test results and adapted the majority of a general management standard to a newer standard for a lab inspection (dozens and dozens of documents). Before this, I already worked at home with an acquaintance who works there, on the same kind of documents.

I now started working from February 3 at a Romanian courier shipping company, in the position of 'Dispatch', where I pretty much do just office work regarding packages and package tracking. If new orders are placed after noon (12), they're postponed until tomorrow. For the orders that are placed before that, I assign couriers based on their coverage area. That's what I did on my first day, at least. I expect to learn more, such as generating AWBs from e-mails (so, if orders aren't placed via the site/selfAWB or the app), and more kinds of orders, shipping types, other situations such as cancellations, etc. Myself included, there's 4 people in the Dispatch department. Couple more in Customer Support, and a couple more in other departments, HR and leadership. Everyone's friendly, chill and casual.

In the summer I'll apply to college, so if I get accepted, I'll quit working here by the end of August since they don't have part-time or hybrid/remote positions for this kind of work.

And since I got this out of the way, I'll look into donating my 3.5% income tax as well, ideally I'd divide it to multiple NGOs, but I'm not sure if I'd still do that, or just support one NGO from this income tax, since it's a small % of my already rather small salary, anyway. So right now I'm divided between Starea Natiei or MozaiQ.

## Contact
If you have any questions, suggestions or something else, here's where you can contact me:
- Mastodon: [*@alextecplayz@techhub.social*](https://techhub.social/@AlexTECPlayz)

I won't accept friend requests on Steam. Unless I really know you, there's no chance I'll accept your friend request.

I have accounts on platforms like Instagram/Threads ([@alextecplayz](https://instagram.com/alextecplayz) / [@alextecplayz@threads.net](https://threads.net/alextecplayz)), reddit ([u/TECPlayz2-0](https://new.reddit.com/user/TECPlayz2-0)), Discord (alextecplayz) and Twitter ([@AlexTECPlayz](https://twitter.com/AlexTECPlayz)) (*was [@realTECPlayz](https://web.archive.org/web/20230320004115/twitter.com/realTECPlayz) but I changed the username on November 13, 2024*), but **I don't use them anymore**. I do not have a Signal, Threema, Session, or some other account. If you see someone claiming to be me on some platform, let me know.

If you really must contact me, it's best to message me on Mastodon or send me an email. I will not see or answer messages sent on other platforms.

## Worldview

Here's my worldview on many things. I try not to opine on things I know nothing or very little about, but I will be cautious and sceptical about approaching such topics. But on the short, I'm not a Socialist, definitely not a Communist, Anarchist, or some other political ideology. I'm simply 'Progressive', I don't think I can find a specific ideology I can align with, and that's just fine.

Quite long, so it's behind a collapsed section, but here are many, many things if you really want to look into what I specifically support or don't support. Sorted alphabetically, A->Z

        <td><strong>Unschooling can be detrimental to your child’s education.</strong> A proper curriculum cannot be replaced by simply giving your child a device and letting them choose what to learn. Some argue against conformity, suggesting that children shouldn’t have to follow classroom norms, especially those with ADHD. However, learning to adapt to societal expectations is essential for functioning in society. While there are exceptions for neurodivergent children, it’s crucial to ensure they receive a structured education, whether through Special Ed Schools or homeschooling with a proper curriculum and qualified teachers, rather than relying on apps or unqualified ‘educators’. Some may claim that real-life experiences, like grocery shopping, can teach valuable skills. However, foundational subjects like math should be taught in a structured environment, building on what they learn in school. <br><br> <strong>Research shows that unschooled children often perform worse than their peers who follow a structured curriculum in key areas like reading, writing, and math.</strong> <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1363975.pdf">American Families’ Attitudes to Unschooling - A National Survey</a> <br><br> Studies indicate that unschooling does not consistently provide equitable educational experiences. For instance, Martin-Chang et al. (2011) found that children educated without structured lesson plans performed worse than those in public schools. <br><br> The notion that children shouldn’t learn subjects they dislike, such as math, is misguided. A basic education, including math, language, history, and science, is essential. These subjects cannot be replaced by informal experiences or apps; they should complement formal education. <br><br> Proposing to abolish education systems is a privileged stance. Instead of discarding them, we should work towards reforming and improving these systems for everyone. <br><br> Radical unschooling advocates often misunderstand the role of education. It’s vital to ensure children receive proper instruction, especially in critical developmental periods. If you believe your education system is lacking, advocate for change rather than abandonment. <br><br> <strong>Be cautious of radical unschoolers; their approach may not be in your child’s best interest.</strong> I hope the trend of unschooling fades away in favor of more effective educational practices.</td>
