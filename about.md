Hi! I'm Alex.

I currently go by he/him they/them pronouns, but I will switch to she/her they/them at some point when I begin to transition.

I'm 19, Transfem, Aromantic, Bisexual, Non-Binary with a hint of Asexuality, Agenderism, and Genderfluidity, living in Romania for the time being, but I'm split between staying or moving the fuck out of the country. I'm also an Atheist, have been since I was at least 12, but the signs were always there. Guess I'm a furry too, what a surprise, huh?

## What I do

In my free time (and before I started working at the lab - [see section below](#what-i-do-as-well)), I work on games in Unreal Engine using Blueprints, such as the newly announced [Prisonia](https://vantainteractive.com/en/games/Prisonia), very slowly develop my own game engine named Sapphire using C++ (*with additional language support down the road*), work on other software such as Android apps (Kotlin, Java) and Linux programs (Qt6, bash, Python) and websites such as [the one you're currently browsing](alextecplayz.github.io), or the [Vanta Interactive website](https://vantainteractive.com), with it's own subdomains for [Docs](https://docs.vantainteractive.com), [Legal](https://legal.vantainteractive.com) and [Status](https://status.vantainteractive.com)

I like to tinker with stuff, I sometimes decompile apps through JADX, tinker with stuff such as AI (LLMs, mostly), play around with Blueprints, Widgets in Unreal, have an affinity for adding as much customization to my stuff as possible, and also make some [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@alextecplaz) videos, without a schedule

Another thing I like a lot is science, especially astronomy. I have a fascination with black holes, they're just so mysterious and cool.

I'm also slightly interested in stuff like hormones, psychology and how the human brain works. Could by gender identity, my romantic or sexual orientation be affected by me having (*undiagnosed*) SzPD? Could they be intertwined? Who knows, the human body is a complex machine, and there's so much we still don't know.

## What I do as well

I currently work as an on-site freelancer at a small hospital's laboratory section. What do I do? Work in Excel, Word, register lab test results, antibiotics, reference strains in tables, adapt documents to new and ever-changing standards that are required for each yearly inspection (RENAR), and general 'office' work. I'm not a medical assistant or doctor, nor do I wish to be one. It's not always pleasant, it's boring and sometimes strains me mentally, but the pay is alright, and I don't plan on doing this for long, if my other [venture](https://vantainteractive.com) succeeds. I plan on using a portion of the pay to get started on HRT, so hopefully that happens soon enough. (*Side note on this: If you're from Romania, or know a good doctor/psychologist/whatever is needed to prescribe me HRT in Cluj-Napoca, don't hesitate to contact me on social media or e-mail. It would be very helpful.*)

**I am open to work** if you want a no-frills website using static generators such as Jekyll, with just enough JS for fancier stuff, no tracking or analytics provided. If you're interested, [contact me](#contact), and we'll have a quick chat to see if I'm up for the task.

## Politics

I'm a left-wing socialist/progressive. I don't believe either extremes - *Communism, Nazism, Fascism* - are good, or a 'solution' to whatever these ideologies are being proposed. Fascism, nazism are, quite clearly, fucking atrocious and we should all work on preventing them from rising again to power. Communism can easily devolve into an authoritarian nightmare, where stuff like the state is the only religion / religion is banned, and work unions are seemingly 'not needed', which just sounds like BS. Don't forget about the secret police. Communism isn't an utopia, it will never be one. You can probably understand my reservations considering I live in Romania, and am generally familiar with some of the heinous shit that was done during communism in the 'Socialist Republic of Romania'. I'm a pacifist, and we would use violence as a last resort. I don't think a literal revolution is the only way to solve some of our stuff, especially if we could achieve the same objectives in a 'cleaner' manner through gradual reform. Fuck capitalism, let's develop something better.

Fuck corporations, Big '[enter topic here]', invasive governments. I use GitHub because it's the most popular, but someday, if I have the money, I'll self-host my own GitLab server, among other things. I use Cloudflare because they're a 'trustworthy' service through which I can buy domains, and the interface is super intuitive and pretty.

## Contact
If you have any questions, suggestions or something else, here's where you can contact me:
- E-mail: [*alextec70@protonmail.com*](mailto:alextec70@protonmail.com)
- Mastodon: [*@alextecplayz@techhub.social*](https://techhub.social/@AlexTECPlayz) (*I'd like to self-host my own Mastodon instance someday, however*)
- Matrix: [*@alextecplayz:matrix.org*](https://matrix.to/#/@alextecplayz:matrix.org)

I have accounts on platforms like Instagram/Threads ([@alextecplayz](https://instagram.com/alextecplayz) / [@alextecplayz@threads.net](https://threads.net/alextecplayz)), reddit ([u/TECPlayz2-0](https://new.reddit.com/user/TECPlayz2-0)), Discord (alextecplayz) and Twitter ([@realTECPlayz](https://twitter.com/realTECPlayz)), but **I don't use them anymore**. If you really must contact me, it's best to message me on Mastodon or send me an email. I will not see or answer messages sent on other platforms. I might use Discord if I want to send out playtest invitations to people I know, but I don't use it for anything else. Neither I or Vanta Interactive have a Discord server. Messages unrelated to playtests or game feedback will **not** be read or replied to.
