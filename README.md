My website. Tech and gaming leaks, reviews, small talk, ideas and other crazy stuff, you can find it all here.

With the new website update (V2), a new era begins in style. I'll start being more active as much as possible, posting dev previews of features I work on in my games, future plans, ramblings, and the usual stuff.

# NOTICE! Only one article will be currently available on the new website, as of 16 December, 02:00 Romania time, until later the same day (est. 17:00 Romania time)
