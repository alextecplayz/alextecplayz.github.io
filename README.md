### alextecplayz.github.io
My website. Posts about tech, ideas, announcements and changes, sneak peeks, pages for my games and projects, my portfolio, and soon, my music and videos. It's all coming here, very soon.

**Upcoming changes for the V1.5 update of the site:**\
With the new website update nearing completion, here's a small sneak peek to what's coming in the new version:

### üî≤ Obsidian Design System 1.5
The Obsidian Design System will release to the public soon after the new website is released. Currently, plans are to release a web and an Unreal Engine version of the design system, with possible future releases for Android, Linux and Windows.

The new design system update not only contains visual updates, but functionality changes as well:
- Share: Share buttons for all posts
- 'Vertical Slices': Will be showcased in a case study for all the previous iterations of my website, and ideas I've had/have for the website. It will feature interactive portions of older website iterations, images, animations, etc. This will be used in the future for project announcements or sneak peeks, like 3D model viewers (*Not confirmed yet*).
- Fancy stuff like microinteractions, fast & fluid animations, progress indicators
- Image viewer, and soon after, Videos and Music player, as I continue to unify my stuff in a single place
- Dedicated pages, documentation for the design system once it releases, including an e-mail & RSS newsletter specific for the design system's launch and future updates (*No spam, I promise*)
- More UI improvements for phones and tablets, and even foldables. I have neglected this for a while, but improvements to make everything look nice are finally happening

These aren't all the changes, but more details will be added in the release notes in the CHANGELOG.md file once the update comes out.

Also an announcement about the Obsidian Design System: It will be **FREE** to use for personal and small-scale projects, but will have paid options (not subscriptions) for large business and commercial applications, including templates or custom iterations. More details will be added soon, when the website updates.

In a continued efford to unify my stuff, I have decided to also unify the OR8 Wiki from my 0R8-Wiki repo to a dedicated portion of my website. It will have its own theming and style based on Obsidian, but it won't have all the features, as it doesn't need some stuff.

The OR8 Wiki merge isn't simple. I've rewritten all articles, even added a lot more articles and pages to the wiki, I think it will look fantastic when it comes out.

### üìÇ Projects showcase
All my projects will be eventually showcased on the website. New additions to the Projects page include more details about the projects I'm working on, overall progress bars, any possible delays, cancellations, incoming announcements.

In addition, most, if not all projects will also eventually get some Vertical Slices to showcase some of the stuff I'm working on. This means possible downloadable demos, sneak peeks, content announcements, etc. I can already confirm that Projects Mountain, Hangar, Odyssey and Morel will get such interactive stuff.

And obviously, games will get their own game pages, projects will get their own pages, and so on.

While there's no release date set in stone, I expect the new website to launch near the end of June, or the start of July. I have my final exams, I'm busy with some other things behind the scenes as well, and while I initially expected to launch the new website in April, I wanted to add more stuff to this release. I'm still debating wether it should be considered a V1.5 or a V2 update. Regardless, the website will always be in a state of developoment, with new ideas, plans and concepts in the works, and I'm excited for what the future holds.

### <img src="https://i.ibb.co/ZYbPHGV/Manifold-White.png" height="2.5%" width="2.5%"> Vanta Interactive website update
I apologise for missing the supposed release timeframe for the VI website. As I have mentioned above, the project grew in size with more ideas and such. I'm excited to say the VI website will get the website update at the same time as my website. While there's not much to show yet, you can still browse the old posts and stuff. (*Also the logo used here is not final*)

### üìÑ New license change
A new license has been added, and the website itself will be licensed using the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, instead of the old AGPL-3.0 license. If you already have a copy of the website, you can still abide by that license. The new license will be effective starting now, and will continue to be used when the new update comes out. It simply serves my needs better. You can use the website for personal use or exploration (case studies, exploration, design inspiration), but you may not use it commercially, unless I specifically grant you the permission to do so.

### ‚è≤Ô∏è The future
I don't want to reveal yet what plans the future holds for the website, but I'm thinking about buying a domain for the website, same goes for the Vanta Interactive website.
