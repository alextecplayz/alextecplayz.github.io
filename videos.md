  - title: "Unreal Engine 5 - Turn In Place (Matt Aspland's video, but for UE5)"
    description: "I took Matt Aspland's UE4 video and made it work with Unreal Engine 5. Because 'Get Turn' doesn't seem to exist in UE5, there's a simple and easy fix - get the X axis value from either the IA_Look EnhancedInputAction, or the X axis value from your Turn axis movement. The video was recorded using Unreal Engine 5.2.1, but it should work with all versions of UE5."

  - title: "HITMAN Freelancer - Intro / Launch Cinematic Music"
    description: "Tried to extract the music used in the original video, here's the result. Some effects couldn't be removed, unfortunately, as I'm not really that good at audio editing. Credit goes to IO Interactive and Niels Bye Nielsen. Also, yet again I ask for IOI to publish the music used in briefings, cutscenes and other cinematics to the official HITMAN 3 Soundtrack, this stuff is really awesome, and the original music would obviously sound better than any of my attempts at removing voices and sound effects."

  - title: "The Hello Neighbor 2 'Demo' is embarrassing"
    description: "The latest Hello Neighbor 2 Demo, if it can even be called a demo, is horrific. This 'AI Demo' is supposed to represent the final game, the new-and-improved Neighbor AI. Except, it's nowhere near good. It's laughably bad, glitchy, and rarely actually does anything 'new'. My expectations were very low for HN2, but holy shit, I never expected it this terrible. It's a proper downgrade from the first game's AI, which did place traps and did try to find other ways to reach the player. With HN2's AI, you could run in circles endlessly, and the AI would not try to find a different way."
