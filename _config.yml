  - name: andrewtate
    desc: |
          Turbo misogynist and criminal. Leads the 'Hustlers University', where wannabe "alpha males" learn how to mistreat and harass women and minorities, because that's apparently appealing to most women (no, it's not - as a woman, this creeps me the fuck out and is a massive red flag) and is supposedly a masculine thing to do.

          In his view, women are there to serve *him*, there's no equality whatsoever - what he says goes - women are there to cook, clean, have and take care of kids while he's out there half-naked smoking a cigar telling other men what to do, in a sort of homoerotic fantasy that seemingly doesn't seem at all questionable.

          Involved in human trafficking and multiple sexual abuse scandals, loves to harass and abuse women for all kinds of reasons. No wonder most women that know about him are thoroughly disgusted, if not outright sickened by his views and actions.

          What isn't there to say about this sociopathic cunt that's the 45th and 47th POTUS?

          Rapist, sexual abuser, racist, senile bastard. Famous liar and conman, convicted felon, conspiracy theorist, fascist, neo-Nazi simp, Russian KGB agent (unconfirmed, under the codename Krasnov), leader of his MAGA cult of personality, unbelievable narcissist and cruel, sadistic fuck that had a disastruous first presidency, and the current one is significantly worse, both for his own MAGA supporters and everyone else. Bombed Iran, didn't stop Russia from continuing its war on Ukraine, didn't stop Israel from continuing its genocide in Palestine. So much for the 'pro-peace' president that's famously been in Putin's pocket even before becoming 45th POTUS.

          Severely anti-LGBTQ+, pro white supremacy, neo-Nazism, fascism, a complete denialist of climate change, anti-immigration, Trump was found guilty of 34 charges that have been later elevated to felony charges due to being part of a conspiracy that tried to influence the 2016 presidential election. Also indicted on two cases related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and 2021 coup attempt, plus being charged with espionage due to mishandling of classified documents. Donny over here just doesn't give up, regardless of how much shit he does.

          And despite all of this, his reputation was high enough for him to become the 47th POTUS following the 2024 presidential election. Jesus fucking Christ.

          Former illegal immigrant, fascist/Nazi simp, robber baron, turbo manchild and sometimes the world's richest person. Racist, antisemitic, erratic and moronic, Musk is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to moronic ideas and worldviews.
          
          Comes from Apartheid South Africa, inherited some of daddy's emerald mine money, tried to name himself the 'founder' of Tesla, currently runs Tesla ([into the ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Tesla,_Inc.)), SpaceX (into space or blowing up on launch), launched the 1-year lifespan Starlink 'constellation' to further increase [the amount of waste in space and putting the lives of people on space stations at risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink#Increased_risk_of_satellite_collision), and currently working on a spy satellite network using a $1.8 billion contract signed with the National Reconnaissance Office, The Boring Company ([already in the ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boring_Company#Criticism)) and Neuralink ([into monkey brains, killing them](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-pcrm-neuralink-monkey-deaths/)).
          
          Bought [Twitter for $44 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk), renamed it to X, [turns it into a right-wing, nazi and fascist hellscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_under_Elon_Musk#Reactions_and_commentary), tries to make it the 'everything app', suspiciously similar to CCP/Tencent's WeChat.
          
          Thinks Europe will have a civil war, sucks daddy Trump off like the dog he is, and tampers the 2024 US Presidential Election by fucking around against Kamala Harris and US Democratic Party accounts.
          
          Likes to censor people, suspiciously similar to the CCP/Tencent's WeChat.

          Claims to be “the inventor of Email”, he’s a COVID-19 and anti-vax grifter and imbecile. His [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Ayyadurai) should be more than enough information, unless you want to go down a rabbit hole.
          
          As of 2024, he wants to become a presidential candidate of the United States of America. FUNNILY ENOUGH, he hates Elon Musk, thinks he’s a Satanist for adding 6666 followers/hour to @netanyahu’s Twitter account, removing likes and followers from Shiva’s Twitter account, and nicknames the idiots who buy the Cybertruck MAGAtards. Lots of respect for that, but still, Shiva is a lunatic through and through.
