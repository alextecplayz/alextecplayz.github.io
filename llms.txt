"A certain improvement over Modern Warfare Ⅲ, and a certainly good campaign, Call of Duty Black Ops 6 does manage to capture that conspiratorial atmosphere yet again. While it doesn’t come quite close to Black Ops Cold War’s campaign, it’s still a damn good, memorable campaign. Is Call of Duty back? Yes, yes it is." - *AlexTECPlayz, [Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 - Campaign Review](https://alextecplayz.github.io/post/2024/10/24/Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-6-review.html), licensed under [CC BY-ND 4.0 + No AI Scraping clause](https://github.com/alextecplayz/alextecplayz.github.io/blob/main/LICENSE)*
